"REALM: RAG-Driven Enhancement of Multimodal Electronic Health Records
  Analysis via Large Language Models","  The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has
significantly improved clinical predictive capabilities. Leveraging clinical
notes and multivariate time-series EHR, existing models often lack the medical
context relevent to clinical tasks, prompting the incorporation of external
knowledge, particularly from the knowledge graph (KG). Previous approaches with
KG knowledge have primarily focused on structured knowledge extraction,
neglecting unstructured data modalities and semantic high dimensional medical
knowledge. In response, we propose REALM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR representations that address
these limitations. Firstly, we apply Large Language Model (LLM) to encode long
context clinical notes and GRU model to encode time-series EHR data. Secondly,
we prompt LLM to extract task-relevant medical entities and match entities in
professionally labeled external knowledge graph (PrimeKG) with corresponding
medical knowledge. By matching and aligning with clinical standards, our
framework eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency. Lastly, we propose
an adaptive multimodal fusion network to integrate extracted knowledge with
multimodal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on MIMIC-III mortality and
readmission tasks showcase the superior performance of our REALM framework over
baselines, emphasizing the effectiveness of each module. REALM framework
contributes to refining the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare and
bridging the gap with nuanced medical context essential for informed clinical
predictions.

"EMERGE: Enhancing Multimodal Electronic Health Records Predictive
  Modeling with Retrieval-Augmented Generation","  The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has
significantly advanced clinical predictive capabilities. Existing models, which
utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data, often fall short
of incorporating the necessary medical context for accurate clinical tasks,
while previous approaches with knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on
structured knowledge extraction. In response, we propose EMERGE, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR
predictive modeling. We extract entities from both time-series data and
clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and align them with
professional PrimeKG, ensuring consistency. In addition to triplet
relationships, we incorporate entities' definitions and descriptions for richer
semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant
summaries of patients' health statuses. Finally, we fuse the summary with other
modalities using an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention.
Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets' in-hospital
mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of
the EMERGE framework over baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and
analysis highlight the efficacy of each designed module and robustness to data
sparsity. EMERGE contributes to refining the utilization of multimodal EHR data
in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts essential for
informed clinical predictions. We have publicly released the code at

"Is larger always better? Evaluating and prompting large language models
  for non-generative medical tasks","  The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine is growing, but their
ability to handle both structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and
unstructured clinical notes is not well-studied. This study benchmarks various
models, including GPT-based LLMs, BERT-based models, and traditional clinical
predictive models, for non-generative medical tasks utilizing renowned
datasets. We assessed 14 language models (9 GPT-based and 5 BERT-based) and 7
traditional predictive models using the MIMIC dataset (ICU patient records) and
the TJH dataset (early COVID-19 EHR data), focusing on tasks such as mortality
and readmission prediction, disease hierarchy reconstruction, and biomedical
sentence matching, comparing both zero-shot and finetuned performance. Results
indicated that LLMs exhibited robust zero-shot predictive capabilities on
structured EHR data when using well-designed prompting strategies, frequently
surpassing traditional models. However, for unstructured medical texts, LLMs
did not outperform finetuned BERT models, which excelled in both supervised and
unsupervised tasks. Consequently, while LLMs are effective for zero-shot
learning on structured data, finetuned BERT models are more suitable for
unstructured texts, underscoring the importance of selecting models based on
specific task requirements and data characteristics to optimize the application
of NLP technology in healthcare.

"EHRmonize: A Framework for Medical Concept Abstraction from Electronic
  Health Records using Large Language Models","  Electronic health records (EHRs) contain vast amounts of complex data, but
harmonizing and processing this information remains a challenging and costly
task requiring significant clinical expertise. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in various healthcare applications, their potential
for abstracting medical concepts from EHRs remains largely unexplored. We
introduce EHRmonize, a framework leveraging LLMs to abstract medical concepts
from EHR data. Our study uses medication data from two real-world EHR databases
to evaluate five LLMs on two free-text extraction and six binary classification
tasks across various prompting strategies. GPT-4o's with 10-shot prompting
achieved the highest performance in all tasks, accompanied by Claude-3.5-Sonnet
in a subset of tasks. GPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 97% in identifying generic
route names, 82% for generic drug names, and 100% in performing binary
classification of antibiotics. While EHRmonize significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing annotation time by an estimated 60%, we emphasize that
clinician oversight remains essential. Our framework, available as a Python
package, offers a promising tool to assist clinicians in EHR data abstraction,
potentially accelerating healthcare research and improving data harmonization
processes.

"ColaCare: Enhancing Electronic Health Record Modeling through Large
  Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration","  We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record
(EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language
Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models
with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based
reasoning. Inspired by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) approach used in
clinical settings, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgents and a
MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process
and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce
reasoning references and decision-making reports within the MDT-driven
collaborative consultation framework. The MetaAgent orchestrates the
discussion, facilitating consultations and evidence-based debates among
DoctorAgents, simulating diverse expertise in clinical decision-making. We
additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD)
medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for
medical evidence support, addressing the challenge of knowledge currency.
Extensive experiments conducted on three EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's
superior performance in clinical mortality outcome and readmission prediction
tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support
systems and advance personalized precision medicine. All code, case studies and
a questionnaire are available at the project website:

"Retrospective Comparative Analysis of Prostate Cancer In-Basket
  Messages: Responses from Closed-Domain LLM vs. Clinical Teams","  In-basket message interactions play a crucial role in physician-patient
communication, occurring during all phases (pre-, during, and post) of a
patient's care journey. However, responding to these patients' inquiries has
become a significant burden on healthcare workflows, consuming considerable
time for clinical care teams. To address this, we introduce RadOnc-GPT, a
specialized Large Language Model (LLM) powered by GPT-4 that has been designed
with a focus on radiotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer with advanced
prompt engineering, and specifically designed to assist in generating
responses. We integrated RadOnc-GPT with patient electronic health records
(EHR) from both the hospital-wide EHR database and an internal,
radiation-oncology-specific database. RadOnc-GPT was evaluated on 158
previously recorded in-basket message interactions. Quantitative natural
language processing (NLP) analysis and two grading studies with clinicians and
nurses were used to assess RadOnc-GPT's responses. Our findings indicate that
RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in ""Clarity"" and
""Empathy,"" while achieving comparable scores in ""Completeness"" and
""Correctness."" RadOnc-GPT is estimated to save 5.2 minutes per message for
nurses and 2.4 minutes for clinicians, from reading the inquiry to sending the
response. Employing RadOnc-GPT for in-basket message draft generation has the
potential to alleviate the workload of clinical care teams and reduce
healthcare costs by producing high-quality, timely responses.

A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation,"  The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly
through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time
available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To
address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework
designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment,
Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language
Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real
time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate
medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like
Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments.
Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing
healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information
quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate
that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability
of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the
administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality
of clinical workflows.

"RGAR: Recurrence Generation-augmented Retrieval for Factual-aware
  Medical Question Answering","  Medical question answering requires extensive access to specialized
conceptual knowledge. The current paradigm, Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), acquires expertise medical knowledge through large-scale corpus
retrieval and uses this knowledge to guide a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) for generating answers. However, existing retrieval approaches
often overlook the importance of factual knowledge, which limits the relevance
of retrieved conceptual knowledge and restricts its applicability in real-world
scenarios, such as clinical decision-making based on Electronic Health Records
(EHRs). This paper introduces RGAR, a recurrence generation-augmented retrieval
framework that retrieves both relevant factual and conceptual knowledge from
dual sources (i.e., EHRs and the corpus), allowing them to interact and refine
each another. Through extensive evaluation across three factual-aware medical
question answering benchmarks, RGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance among medical RAG systems. Notably, the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model
with RGAR surpasses the considerably larger, RAG-enhanced GPT-3.5. Our findings
demonstrate the benefit of extracting factual knowledge for retrieval, which
consistently yields improved generation quality.

Classifying Cancer Stage with Open-Source Clinical Large Language Models,"  Cancer stage classification is important for making treatment and care
management plans for oncology patients. Information on staging is often
included in unstructured form in clinical, pathology, radiology and other
free-text reports in the electronic health record system, requiring extensive
work to parse and obtain. To facilitate the extraction of this information,
previous NLP approaches rely on labeled training datasets, which are
labor-intensive to prepare. In this study, we demonstrate that without any
labeled training data, open-source clinical large language models (LLMs) can
extract pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging information from
real-world pathology reports. Our experiments compare LLMs and a BERT-based
model fine-tuned using the labeled data. Our findings suggest that while LLMs
still exhibit subpar performance in Tumor (T) classification, with the
appropriate adoption of prompting strategies, they can achieve comparable
performance on Metastasis (M) classification and improved performance on Node
(N) classification.

"Lessons Learned on Information Retrieval in Electronic Health Records: A
  Comparison of Embedding Models and Pooling Strategies","  Objective: Applying large language models (LLMs) to the clinical domain is
challenging due to the context-heavy nature of processing medical records.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution by facilitating
reasoning over large text sources. However, there are many parameters to
optimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation
study exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect
information retrieval for the clinical domain.
  Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record
(EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and
general-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf
decoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each
model, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.
  Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts
retrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model,
consistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models.
However, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and
query text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of
these models to guide future design of retrieval systems.
  Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query
formulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance
of these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new
domains. Further studies such as this one are vital for guiding
empirically-grounded development of retrieval frameworks, such as in the
context of RAG, for the clinical domain.

medical knowledge on colorectal Cancer. It is currently being evaluated to
assist with both medical research and clinical information retrieval tasks at
Moffitt Cancer Center, which is one of the top Cancer centers in the U.S. and
in the world. Our hybrid is remarkable as it serves the user needs better than
just an LLM, KG or a search-engine in isolation. LLMs as is are known to
exhibit hallucinations and catastrophic forgetting as well as are trained on
outdated corpora. The state of the art KGs, such as PrimeKG, cBioPortal,
ChEMBL, NCBI, and other require manual curation, hence are quickly getting
stale. CancerKG is unsupervised and is capable of automatically ingesting and
organizing the latest medical findings. To alleviate the LLMs shortcomings, the
verified KG serves as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) guardrail.
CancerKG exhibits 5 different advanced user interfaces, each tailored to serve
different data modalities better and more convenient for the user.

"AIPatient: Simulating Patients with EHRs and LLM Powered Agentic
  Workflow","  Simulated patient systems play a crucial role in modern medical education and
research, providing safe, integrative learning environments and enabling
clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance
simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor
interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the
effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they
require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a
robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient,
an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient
KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning
RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data
from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for
Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and
relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89).
Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including
retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and
summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in
EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use
either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents
high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade
5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p>0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value
0.782, p>0.1). The promising performance of the AIPatient system highlights its
potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education,
model evaluation, and system integration.

"MedRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-augmented Generation with Knowledge
  Graph-Elicited Reasoning for Healthcare Copilot","  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for
retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a
key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for
healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and
specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain
are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This
paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited
reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment
recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a
comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical
diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically
integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned
within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific
decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to
enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a
public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD)
collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against
various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the
information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides
more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in
reducing misdiagnosis rates. Our code will be available at

"DualMAR: Medical-Augmented Representation from Dual-Expertise
  Perspectives","  Electronic Health Records (EHR) has revolutionized healthcare data management
and prediction in the field of AI and machine learning. Accurate predictions of
diagnosis and medications significantly mitigate health risks and provide
guidance for preventive care. However, EHR driven models often have limited
scope on understanding medical-domain knowledge and mostly rely on
simple-and-sole ontologies. In addition, due to the missing features and
incomplete disease coverage of EHR, most studies only focus on basic analysis
on conditions and medication. We propose DualMAR, a framework that enhances EHR
prediction tasks through both individual observation data and public knowledge
bases. First, we construct a bi-hierarchical Diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG)
using verified public clinical ontologies and augment this KG via Large
Language Models (LLMs); Second, we design a new proxy-task learning on lab
results in EHR for pretraining, which further enhance KG representation and
patient embeddings. By retrieving radial and angular coordinates upon polar
space, DualMAR enables accurate predictions based on rich hierarchical and
semantic embeddings from KG. Experiments also demonstrate that DualMAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models, validating its effectiveness in EHR
prediction and KG integration in medical domains.

"Question-Answering Based Summarization of Electronic Health Records
  using Retrieval Augmented Generation","  Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize
'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years
summarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of
the art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate
results that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated
data for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of
an EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that
attention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic
complexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that
mitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach
summarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are
deemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite
efficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the
'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary
will not have repeated content but diverse answers to specific questions.

foundation models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in
planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, a
fully automated treatment planning framework that harnesses prior radiation
oncology knowledge encoded in multi-modal large language models, such as
GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI. GPT-RadPlan is made aware of planning

"Application of NotebookLM, a Large Language Model with
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation, for Lung Cancer Staging","  Purpose: In radiology, large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, have
recently gained attention, and their utility is being rapidly evaluated.
However, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in clinical
applications due to limitations such as hallucinations and insufficient
referencing. To address these issues, we focus on the latest technology,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables LLMs to reference reliable
external knowledge (REK). Specifically, this study examines the utility and
reliability of a recently released RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for
staging lung cancer.
  Materials and methods: We summarized the current lung cancer staging
guideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We then tasked
NotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings
and evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we performed the same task using a
gold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), both with and without the REK.
  Results: NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer
staging experiment, outperforming GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the
REK and 25% without it. Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in
searching reference locations within the REK.
  Conclusion: NotebookLM successfully performed lung cancer staging by
utilizing the REK, demonstrating superior performance compared to GPT-4o.
Additionally, it provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK,
allowing radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's
responses and detect possible hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights
the potential of NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, in image diagnosis.

"Towards Efficient Patient Recruitment for Clinical Trials: Application
  of a Prompt-Based Learning Model","  Objective: Clinical trials are essential for advancing pharmaceutical
interventions, but they face a bottleneck in selecting eligible participants.
Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained
popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents
challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer
models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based
large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical
notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we
selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria
needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility
criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based
on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with
the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the
extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we
evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2
challenge, which aimed to classify medical records of 311 patients based on 13
eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed
the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among
the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset.
Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this
study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising
scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid
of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.

"Developing an Artificial Intelligence Tool for Personalized Breast
  Cancer Treatment Plans based on the NCCN Guidelines","  Cancer treatments require personalized approaches based on a patient's
clinical condition, medical history, and evidence-based guidelines. The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides frequently updated,
complex guidelines through visuals like flowcharts and diagrams, which can be
time consuming for oncologists to stay current with treatment protocols. This
study presents an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven methodology to accurately
automate treatment regimens following NCCN guidelines for breast cancer
patients.
  We proposed two AI-driven methods: Agentic-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
Generation) and Graph-RAG. Agentic-RAG used a three-step Large Language Model
(LLM) process to select clinical titles from NCCN guidelines, retrieve matching
JSON content, and iteratively refine recommendations based on insufficiency
checks. Graph-RAG followed a Microsoft-developed framework with proprietary
prompts, where JSON data was converted to text via an LLM, summarized, and
mapped into graph structures representing key treatment relationships. Final
recommendations were generated by querying relevant graph summaries. Both were
evaluated using a set of patient descriptions, each with four associated
questions.
  As shown in Table 1, Agentic RAG achieved a 100% adherence (24/24) with no
hallucinations or incorrect treatments. Graph-RAG had 95.8% adherence (23/24)
with one incorrect treatment and no hallucinations. Chat GPT-4 showed 91.6%
adherence (22/24) with two wrong treatments and no hallucinations. Both Agentic
RAG and Graph-RAG provided detailed treatment recommendations with accurate
references to relevant NCCN document page numbers.

"Accuracy and Consistency of LLMs in the Registered Dietitian Exam: The
  Impact of Prompt Engineering and Knowledge Retrieval","  Large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally transforming human-facing
applications in the health and well-being domains: boosting patient engagement,
accelerating clinical decision-making, and facilitating medical education.
Although state-of-the-art LLMs have shown superior performance in several
conversational applications, evaluations within nutrition and diet applications
are still insufficient. In this paper, we propose to employ the Registered
Dietitian (RD) exam to conduct a standard and comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, assessing
both accuracy and consistency in nutrition queries. Our evaluation includes
1050 RD exam questions encompassing several nutrition topics and proficiency
levels. In addition, for the first time, we examine the impact of Zero-Shot
(ZS), Chain of Thought (CoT), Chain of Thought with Self Consistency (CoT-SC),
and Retrieval Augmented Prompting (RAP) on both accuracy and consistency of the
responses. Our findings revealed that while these LLMs obtained acceptable
overall performance, their results varied considerably with different prompts
and question domains. GPT-4o with CoT-SC prompting outperformed the other
approaches, whereas Gemini 1.5 Pro with ZS recorded the highest consistency.
For GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, CoT improved the accuracy, and CoT-SC improved both
accuracy and consistency. RAP was particularly effective for GPT-4o to answer
Expert level questions. Consequently, choosing the appropriate LLM and
prompting technique, tailored to the proficiency level and specific domain, can
mitigate errors and potential risks in diet and nutrition chatbots.

student-teacher architecture, utilizing Zephyr-7b-beta and Phi3-mini-128 as
student models and GPT-4o as the teacher, to dynamically select between prompt

open-world framework that uses external KGs to improve EHR-based predictions.
Our method extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and external
biomedical KGs to build patient-specific KGs, which are then used to train our
proposed Bi-attention AugmenTed (BAT) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare
predictions. On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, \textsc{GraphCare}

boosts AUROC by 17.6\% and 6.6\% for mortality and readmission, and F1-score by
7.9\% and 10.8\% for LOS and drug recommendation, respectively. Notably,

"Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Medicine with Iterative
  Follow-up Questions","  The emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
great potential in solving medical questions. They can possess considerable
medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the
knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed
to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external
knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of
information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose
iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up
queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of
i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a conventional RAG system
and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next
iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs
brought by i-MedRAG compared with conventional RAG on complex questions from
clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE),
as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all

RuCCoD: Towards Automated ICD Coding in Russian,"  This study investigates the feasibility of automating clinical coding in
Russian, a language with limited biomedical resources. We present a new dataset
for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records
(EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD
codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models,
including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining
transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis)
and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the
best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient
histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated
test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to
a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from
physicians. We believe our findings offer valuable insights into the potential
for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages like Russian,
which could enhance clinical efficiency and data accuracy in these contexts.

"Assessing the Usability of GutGPT: A Simulation Study of an AI Clinical
  Decision Support System for Gastrointestinal Bleeding Risk","  Applications of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have potential to
enhance clinical decision support through conversational interfaces. However,
challenges of human-algorithmic interaction and clinician trust are poorly
understood. GutGPT, a LLM for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk prediction
and management guidance, was deployed in clinical simulation scenarios
alongside the electronic health record (EHR) with emergency medicine
physicians, internal medicine physicians, and medical students to evaluate its
effect on physician acceptance and trust in AI clinical decision support
systems (AI-CDSS). GutGPT provides risk predictions from a validated machine
learning model and evidence-based answers by querying extracted clinical
guidelines. Participants were randomized to GutGPT and an interactive
dashboard, or the interactive dashboard and a search engine. Surveys and
educational assessments taken before and after measured technology acceptance
and content mastery. Preliminary results showed mixed effects on acceptance
after using GutGPT compared to the dashboard or search engine but appeared to
improve content mastery based on simulation performance. Overall, this study
demonstrates LLMs like GutGPT could enhance effective AI-CDSS if implemented
optimally and paired with interactive interfaces.

"Large Language Models for Medical OSCE Assessment: A Novel Approach to
  Transcript Analysis","  Grading Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) is a
time-consuming and expensive process, traditionally requiring extensive manual
effort from human experts. In this study, we explore the potential of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess skills related to medical student
communication. We analyzed 2,027 video-recorded OSCE examinations from the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), spanning four years
(2019-2022), and several different medical cases or ""stations."" Specifically,
our focus was on evaluating students' ability to summarize patients' medical
history: we targeted the rubric item 'did the student summarize the patients'
medical history?' from the communication skills rubric. After transcribing
speech audio captured by OSCE videos using Whisper-v3, we studied the
performance of various LLM-based approaches for grading students on this
summarization task based on their examination transcripts. Using various
frontier-level open-source and proprietary LLMs, we evaluated different
techniques such as zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval augmented
generation, and multi-model ensemble methods. Our results show that frontier
LLM models like GPT-4 achieved remarkable alignment with human graders,
demonstrating a Cohen's kappa agreement of 0.88 and indicating strong potential
for LLM-based OSCE grading to augment the current grading process. Open-source
models also showed promising results, suggesting potential for widespread,
cost-effective deployment. Further, we present a failure analysis identifying
conditions where LLM grading may be less reliable in this context and recommend
best practices for deploying LLMs in medical education settings.

using a large-scale real-world electronic health record database, nor have
evaluated its utility in providing clinical diagnostic assistance for patients
across a full range of disease presentation. We performed two analyses using
ChatGPT and GPT-4, one to identify patients with specific medical diagnoses
using a real-world large electronic health record database and the other, in
providing diagnostic assistance to healthcare workers in the prospective
evaluation of hypothetical patients. Our results show that GPT-4 across disease
classification tasks with chain of thought and few-shot prompting can achieve
performance as high as 96% F1 scores. For patient assessment, GPT-4 can
accurately diagnose three out of four times. However, there were mentions of
factually incorrect statements, overlooking crucial medical findings,
recommendations for unnecessary investigations and overtreatment. These issues
coupled with privacy concerns, make these models currently inadequate for real
world clinical use. However, limited data and time needed for prompt
engineering in comparison to configuration of conventional machine learning
workflows highlight their potential for scalability across healthcare
applications.

MedPromptX: Grounded Multimodal Prompting for Chest X-ray Diagnosis,"  Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic
cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured
clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records
(EHR). This paper introduces MedPromptX, the first clinical decision support
system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot
prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for
chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing
EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical
history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs
while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the
process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting
high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model
performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines
few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG
narrows the search area in X-ray images, thereby enhancing the identification
of abnormalities. We also release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual
question answering dataset encompassing interleaved images and EHR data derived
from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR-JPG databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA
performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to
the baselines. Code and data are publicly available on

"Clinical Decision Transformer: Intended Treatment Recommendation through
  Goal Prompting","  With recent achievements in tasks requiring context awareness, foundation
models have been adopted to treat large-scale data from electronic health
record (EHR) systems. However, previous clinical recommender systems based on
foundation models have a limited purpose of imitating clinicians' behavior and
do not directly consider a problem of missing values. In this paper, we propose
Clinical Decision Transformer (CDT), a recommender system that generates a
sequence of medications to reach a desired range of clinical states given as
goal prompts. For this, we conducted goal-conditioned sequencing, which
generated a subsequence of treatment history with prepended future goal state,
and trained the CDT to model sequential medications required to reach that goal
state. For contextual embedding over intra-admission and inter-admissions, we
adopted a GPT-based architecture with an admission-wise attention mask and
column embedding. In an experiment, we extracted a diabetes dataset from an EHR
system, which contained treatment histories of 4788 patients. We observed that
the CDT achieved the intended treatment effect according to goal prompt ranges
(e.g., NormalA1c, LowerA1c, and HigherA1c), contrary to the case with behavior
cloning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore
clinical recommendations from the perspective of goal prompting. See

"Evaluation of General Large Language Models in Contextually Assessing
  Semantic Concepts Extracted from Adult Critical Care Electronic Health Record
  Notes","  The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large
Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance. However, their
performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored. Traditional
evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced
contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical
assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult
critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods,
including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the
performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world
clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and
then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by
identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different
prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior
performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and
text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting
strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable
efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.
Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for
LLMs is developed and operationalized. This framework goes beyond singular
performance aspects. With expert annotations, this methodology not only
validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also
establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.

"Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated
  Structured Data Extraction from Diagnostic Reports","  Purpose: To develop and evaluate an automated system for extracting
structured clinical information from unstructured radiology and pathology
reports using open-weights large language models (LMs) and retrieval augmented
generation (RAG), and to assess the effects of model configuration variables on
extraction performance. Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets:
7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System
(BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to
benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of
model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and
inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing
models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology
reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports.
The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain
fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model
quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting
significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology
reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs
demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured
clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving
application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated
optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These
approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows,

  Language Models on Dietary Supplements","  \textbf{Objective:} We aimed to develop an advanced multi-task large language
model (LLM) framework to extract multiple types of information about dietary
supplements (DS) from clinical records.
  \textbf{Methods:} We used four core DS information extraction tasks - namely,
named entity recognition (NER: 2,949 clinical sentences), relation extraction
(RE: 4,892 sentences), triple extraction (TE: 2,949 sentences), and usage
classification (UC: 2,460 sentences) as our multitasks. We introduced a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Multi-task Information Extraction (RAMIE) Framework,
including: 1) employed instruction fine-tuning techniques with task-specific
prompts, 2) trained LLMs for multiple tasks with improved storage efficiency
and lower training costs, and 3) incorporated retrieval augmentation generation
(RAG) techniques by retrieving similar examples from the training set. We
compared RAMIE's performance to LLMs with instruction fine-tuning alone and
conducted an ablation study to assess the contributions of multi-task learning
and RAG to improved multitasking performance.
  \textbf{Results:} With the aid of the RAMIE framework, Llama2-13B achieved an
F1 score of 87.39 (3.51\% improvement) on the NER task and demonstrated
outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\%

  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that
demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for
DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied
to other domains.

knowledge hidden in these LLMs, we need to design effective prompts that can
guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific

science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different
LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and systematic experimental study on prompt engineering for five
clinical NLP tasks: Clinical Sense Disambiguation, Biomedical Evidence
Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Medication Status Extraction, and
Medication Attribute Extraction. We assessed the prompts proposed in recent

triaging, preliminary tests like visual acuity assessment, and report
summaries. However, LLMs have demonstrated significantly varied performance
across different languages in natural language question-answering tasks,
potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities in Low and Middle-Income

"Reasoning-Enhanced Healthcare Predictions with Knowledge Graph Community
  Retrieval","  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
clinical decision support. Yet LLMs still suffer from hallucinations and lack
fine-grained contextual medical knowledge, limiting their high-stake healthcare
applications such as clinical diagnosis. Traditional retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) methods attempt to address these limitations but frequently
retrieve sparse or irrelevant information, undermining prediction accuracy. We
introduce KARE, a novel framework that integrates knowledge graph (KG)
community-level retrieval with LLM reasoning to enhance healthcare predictions.
KARE constructs a comprehensive multi-source KG by integrating biomedical
databases, clinical literature, and LLM-generated insights, and organizes it
using hierarchical graph community detection and summarization for precise and

dense medical knowledge structuring approach enabling accurate retrieval of
relevant information; (2) a dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism that enriches
patient contexts with focused, multi-faceted medical insights; and (3) a
reasoning-enhanced prediction framework that leverages these enriched contexts
to produce both accurate and interpretable clinical predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KARE outperforms leading models by up to
10.8-15.0% on MIMIC-III and 12.6-12.7% on MIMIC-IV for mortality and

"Leveraging large language models for structured information extraction
  from pathology reports","  Background: Structured information extraction from unstructured
histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research.
Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting
scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction
through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions
without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting
structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to
manual extraction by a trained human annotator.
  Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web
application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold
standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs
including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family,
which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111
histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study,
extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary.
  Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama

performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text,
the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that
languages afford. To this end, we propose to use a knowledge graph as auxiliary
information to guide the LLMs in making predictions. Moreover, to further boost
the LLMs adapt to the problem setting, we apply a chain-of-thought (CoT) sample
selection strategy enhanced by reinforcement learning, which selects a set of
CoT samples given each individual medical report. Experimental results and
various ablation studies show that our few-shot learning method achieves
satisfactory performance compared with fine-tuning strategies and gains superb
advantages when the available data is limited. The code and sample dataset of
the proposed CohortGPT model is available at:

"The Power of Combining Data and Knowledge: GPT-4o is an Effective
  Interpreter of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis of
  Lung Cancer","  Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial
treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of
LNM remains challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered
significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities.
Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can
estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has
historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this
paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge
acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models
to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning
models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the
patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.
Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI,
to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the
estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs
from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final
prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of
0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving
predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The
experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical
knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve
more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform
well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating
medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.

LLMs in Biomedicine: A study on clinical Named Entity Recognition,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable versatility in various
NLP tasks but encounter distinct challenges in biomedical due to the
complexities of language and data scarcity. This paper investigates LLMs
application in the biomedical domain by exploring strategies to enhance their
performance for the NER task. Our study reveals the importance of meticulously
designed prompts in the biomedical. Strategic selection of in-context examples
yields a marked improvement, offering ~15-20\% increase in F1 score across all
benchmark datasets for biomedical few-shot NER. Additionally, our results
indicate that integrating external biomedical knowledge via prompting
strategies can enhance the proficiency of general-purpose LLMs to meet the
specialized needs of biomedical NER. Leveraging a medical knowledge base, our

SM70: A Large Language Model for Medical Devices,"  We are introducing SM70, a 70 billion-parameter Large Language Model that is
specifically designed for SpassMed's medical devices under the brand name
'JEE1' (pronounced as G1 and means 'Life'). This large language model provides
more accurate and safe responses to medical-domain questions. To fine-tune
SM70, we used around 800K data entries from the publicly available dataset
MedAlpaca. The Llama2 70B open-sourced model served as the foundation for SM70,
and we employed the QLoRA technique for fine-tuning. The evaluation is
conducted across three benchmark datasets - MEDQA - USMLE, PUBMEDQA, and USMLE
- each representing a unique aspect of medical knowledge and reasoning. The
performance of SM70 is contrasted with other notable LLMs, including Llama2
70B, Clinical Camel 70 (CC70), GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and Med-Palm, to provide a
comparative understanding of its capabilities within the medical domain. Our
results indicate that SM70 outperforms several established models in these
datasets, showcasing its proficiency in handling a range of medical queries,
from fact-based questions derived from PubMed abstracts to complex clinical
decision-making scenarios. The robust performance of SM70, particularly in the
USMLE and PUBMEDQA datasets, suggests its potential as an effective tool in
clinical decision support and medical information retrieval. Despite its
promising results, the paper also acknowledges the areas where SM70 lags behind
the most advanced model, GPT 4, thereby highlighting the need for further
development, especially in tasks demanding extensive medical knowledge and
intricate reasoning.

"Benchmarking Generative AI for Scoring Medical Student Interviews in
  Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs)","  Introduction. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely
used to assess medical students' communication skills, but scoring
interview-based assessments is time-consuming and potentially subject to human
bias. This study explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to
automate OSCE evaluations using the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS).
  Methods. We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts
across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot,
chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step prompting. The models were
benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores
available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact,
off-by-one, thresholded).
  Results. Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with
low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy
(0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature
parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ($\alpha = 0.98$ for GPT-4o).
CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to
specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items
independent of encounter phases and communication domains.
  Conclusion. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation
and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques.
Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a
foundation for future research in automated assessment of clinical
communication skills.

"Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models Performance in
  Domain-specific Medicine: Osteoarthritis Management with DocOA","  The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific medicine,
particularly for managing complex diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA), remains
largely unexplored. This study focused on evaluating and enhancing the clinical
capabilities of LLMs in specific domains, using osteoarthritis (OA) management
as a case study. A domain specific benchmark framework was developed, which
evaluate LLMs across a spectrum from domain-specific knowledge to clinical
applications in real-world clinical scenarios. DocOA, a specialized LLM
tailored for OA management that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and a specialized assistant, DocOA, using objective and human
evaluations. Results showed that general LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were less
effective in the specialized domain of OA management, particularly in providing
personalized treatment recommendations. However, DocOA showed significant
improvements. This study introduces a novel benchmark framework which assesses
the domain-specific abilities of LLMs in multiple aspects, highlights the
limitations of generalized LLMs in clinical contexts, and demonstrates the
potential of tailored approaches for developing domain-specific medical LLMs.

"Fine-Tuning a Local LLaMA-3 Large Language Model for Automated
  Privacy-Preserving Physician Letter Generation in Radiation Oncology","  Generating physician letters is a time-consuming task in daily clinical
practice. This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models
(LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a
privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings
demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for
effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an
efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited
computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the
hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific
information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style.
ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the
8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician
evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has
limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it
successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories,
recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical
benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a

"Novel Development of LLM Driven mCODE Data Model for Improved Clinical
  Trial Matching to Enable Standardization and Interoperability in Oncology
  Research","  Each year, the lack of efficient data standardization and interoperability in
cancer care contributes to the severe lack of timely and effective diagnosis,
while constantly adding to the burden of cost, with cancer costs nationally
reaching over $208 billion in 2023 alone. Traditional methods regarding
clinical trial enrollment and clinical care in oncology are often manual,
time-consuming, and lack a data-driven approach. This paper presents a novel
framework to streamline standardization, interoperability, and exchange of
cancer domains and enhance the integration of oncology-based EHRs across
disparate healthcare systems. This paper utilizes advanced LLMs and Computer
Engineering to streamline cancer clinical trials and discovery. By utilizing
FHIR's resource-based approach and LLM-generated mCODE profiles, we ensure
timely, accurate, and efficient sharing of patient information across disparate

Text2MDT: Extracting Medical Decision Trees from Medical Texts,"  Knowledge of the medical decision process, which can be modeled as medical
decision trees (MDTs), is critical to build clinical decision support systems.
However, the current MDT construction methods rely heavily on time-consuming
and laborious manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel task,
Text2MDT, to explore the automatic extraction of MDTs from medical texts such
as medical guidelines and textbooks. We normalize the form of the MDT and
create an annotated Text-to-MDT dataset in Chinese with the participation of
medical experts. We investigate two different methods for the Text2MDT tasks:
(a) an end-to-end framework which only relies on a GPT style large language
models (LLM) instruction tuning to generate all the node information and tree
structures. (b) The pipeline framework which decomposes the Text2MDT task to
three subtasks. Experiments on our Text2MDT dataset demonstrate that: (a) the
end-to-end method basd on LLMs (7B parameters or larger) show promising
results, and successfully outperform the pipeline methods. (b) The

"Cancer Vaccine Adjuvant Name Recognition from Biomedical Literature
  using Large Language Models","  Motivation: An adjuvant is a chemical incorporated into vaccines that
enhances their efficacy by improving the immune response. Identifying adjuvant
names from cancer vaccine studies is essential for furthering research and
enhancing immunotherapies. However, the manual curation from the constantly

and Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama). Methods: We utilized two datasets: 97
clinical trial records from AdjuvareDB and 290 abstracts annotated with the
Vaccine Adjuvant Compendium (VAC). GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 were employed in
zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms with up to four examples per prompt.
Prompts explicitly targeted adjuvant names, testing the impact of contextual
information such as substances or interventions. Outputs underwent automated
and manual validation for accuracy and consistency. Results: GPT-4o attained
100% Precision across all situations while exhibiting notable improve in Recall
and F1-scores, particularly with incorporating interventions. On the VAC
dataset, GPT-4o achieved a maximum F1-score of 77.32% with interventions,

applications. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising
approach for customizing domain knowledge in LLMs. This case study presents the
development and evaluation of an LLM-RAG pipeline tailored for healthcare,
focusing specifically on preoperative medicine.
  Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and
tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses
evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text
using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing
these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques
and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for
vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss
metrics. Human-generated answers, provided by junior doctors, were used as a

  Results: The LLM-RAG model generated answers within an average of 15-20
seconds, significantly faster than the 10 minutes typically required by humans.
Among the basic LLMs, GPT4.0 exhibited the best accuracy of 80.1%. This
accuracy was further increased to 91.4% when the model was enhanced with RAG.
Compared to the human-generated instructions, which had an accuracy of 86.3%,
the performance of the GPT4.0 RAG model demonstrated non-inferiority (p=0.610).

"QuaLLM-Health: An Adaptation of an LLM-Based Framework for Quantitative
  Data Extraction from Online Health Discussions","  Health-related discussions on social media like Reddit offer valuable
insights, but extracting quantitative data from unstructured text is
challenging. In this work, we present an adapted framework from QuaLLM into
QuaLLM-Health for extracting clinically relevant quantitative data from Reddit
discussions about glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists using large
language models (LLMs). We collected 410k posts and comments from five
GLP-1-related communities using the Reddit API in July 2024. After filtering
for cancer-related discussions, 2,059 unique entries remained. We developed
annotation guidelines to manually extract variables such as cancer
survivorship, family cancer history, cancer types mentioned, risk perceptions,
and discussions with physicians. Two domain-experts independently annotated a
random sample of 100 entries to create a gold-standard dataset. We then
employed iterative prompt engineering with OpenAI's ""GPT-4o-mini"" on the
gold-standard dataset to build an optimized pipeline that allowed us to extract
variables from the large dataset. The optimized LLM achieved accuracies above
0.85 for all variables, with precision, recall and F1 score macro averaged >
0.90, indicating balanced performance. Stability testing showed a 95% match
rate across runs, confirming consistency. Applying the framework to the full
dataset enabled efficient extraction of variables necessary for downstream
analysis, costing under $3 and completing in approximately one hour.
QuaLLM-Health demonstrates that LLMs can effectively and efficiently extract
clinically relevant quantitative data from unstructured social media content.
Incorporating human expertise and iterative prompt refinement ensures accuracy
and reliability. This methodology can be adapted for large-scale analysis of
patient-generated data across various health domains, facilitating valuable
insights for healthcare research.

"Development and Testing of a Novel Large Language Model-Based Clinical
  Decision Support Systems for Medication Safety in 12 Clinical Specialties","  Importance: We introduce a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-Large
Language Model (LLM) framework as a Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to
support safe medication prescription.
  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based CDSS in correctly
identifying medication errors in different patient case vignettes from diverse
medical and surgical sub-disciplines, against a human expert panel derived
ground truth. We compared performance for under 2 different CDSS practical
healthcare integration modalities: LLM-based CDSS alone (fully autonomous mode)
vs junior pharmacist + LLM-based CDSS (co-pilot, assistive mode).
  Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a RAG model with
state-of-the-art medically-related LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0 and Med-PaLM 2),
this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex
clinical vignettes across 12 different medical and surgical specialties. A
multidisciplinary expert panel assessed these cases for Drug-Related Problems
(DRPs) using the PCNE classification and graded severity / potential for harm
using revised NCC MERP medication error index. We compared.
  Results RAG-LLM performed better compared to LLM alone. When employed in a
co-pilot mode, accuracy, recall, and F1 scores were optimized, indicating
effectiveness in identifying moderate to severe DRPs. The accuracy of DRP
detection with RAG-LLM improved in several categories but at the expense of
lower precision.
  Conclusions This study established that a RAG-LLM based CDSS significantly
boosts the accuracy of medication error identification when used alongside
junior pharmacists (co-pilot), with notable improvements in detecting severe
DRPs. This study also illuminates the comparative performance of current
state-of-the-art LLMs in RAG-based CDSS systems.

"Performance of Large Language Models in Technical MRI Question
  Answering: A Comparative Study","  Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.
  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical
MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned
nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety.
Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and
Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1,
smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the
LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an
automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct
answers, was the primary outcome.
  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy
(94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored
88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source
models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to
several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and
Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History,
and Artifacts and Corrections.
  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI
questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice.
These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical
environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and
integrate them into MRI workflows.

"Unlocking Historical Clinical Trial Data with ALIGN: A Compositional
  Large Language Model System for Medical Coding","  The reuse of historical clinical trial data has significant potential to
accelerate medical research and drug development. However, interoperability
challenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective data
integration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a
promising solution for automated coding without labeled data, current
approaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novel
compositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGN
follows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2)
self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation
enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing
medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history
terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes
extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,
while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA
coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and
excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN
demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC
Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common
medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based
deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably
enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this
cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o,
reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding
for clinical trial data, contributing to enhanced data interoperability and
reusability, positioning it as a promising tool to improve clinical research
and accelerate drug development.

"JMLR: Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training for Enhancing Reasoning
  and Professional Question Answering Capability","  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable potential in
medical knowledge acquisition and question-answering. However, LLMs can
potentially hallucinate and yield factually incorrect outcomes, even with
domain-specific pretraining. Previously, retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
has limited success in addressing hallucinations. Unlike previous methods in
RAG where the retrieval model was trained separately from the LLM, we introduce
JMLR (for Jointly trains LLM and information Retrieval) during the fine-tuning
phase. The synchronized training mechanism enhances JMLR's ability to retrieve
clinical guidelines and leverage medical knowledge to reason and answer
questions and reduces the demand for computational resources. We evaluated JMLR
on the important medical question-answering application. Our experimental

state-of-the-art open-source model using conventional pre-training and
fine-tuning Meditron-70B (68.9%) and Llama2-13B with RAG (67.7%) on a medical

"Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agents for Clinical Decision Making
  in Oncology","  Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to enhance
clinical decision-making by interpreting various types of medical data.
However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is
uncertain. Each discipline presents unique challenges that need to be addressed
for optimal performance. This complexity is further increased when attempting
to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an
alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist
capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.
This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical
AI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image
interpretation, genomic data processing, web searches, and document retrieval
from medical guidelines. We validate our system across a series of clinical
oncology scenarios that closely resemble typical patient care workflows. We
show that the system has a high capability in employing appropriate tools
(97%), drawing correct conclusions (93.6%), and providing complete (94%), and
helpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently
referencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides
evidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to
retrieve or synthesize new information when used as autonomous agents. This
enables them to function as specialist, patient-tailored clinical assistants.
It also simplifies regulatory compliance by allowing each component tool to be
individually validated and approved. We believe, that our work can serve as a
proof-of-concept for more advanced LLM-agents in the medical domain.

Small Models are LLM Knowledge Triggers on Medical Tabular Prediction,"  Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks.
However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on
structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the
numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM
reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data
(e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is
often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This
ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical
nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain
expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by
synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an
unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as
original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a
better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small
model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This
process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for
continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain
tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to
OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to
linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for
tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs
appear.

Prompt Injection Attacks on Large Language Models in Oncology,"  Vision-language artificial intelligence models (VLMs) possess medical
knowledge and can be employed in healthcare in numerous ways, including as
image interpreters, virtual scribes, and general decision support systems.
However, here, we demonstrate that current VLMs applied to medical tasks
exhibit a fundamental security flaw: they can be attacked by prompt injection
attacks, which can be used to output harmful information just by interacting
with the VLM, without any access to its parameters. We performed a quantitative
study to evaluate the vulnerabilities to these attacks in four state of the art
VLMs which have been proposed to be of utility in healthcare: Claude 3 Opus,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Reka Core, and GPT-4o. Using a set of N=297 attacks, we show
that all of these models are susceptible. Specifically, we show that embedding
sub-visual prompts in medical imaging data can cause the model to provide
harmful output, and that these prompts are non-obvious to human observers.
Thus, our study demonstrates a key vulnerability in medical VLMs which should
be mitigated before widespread clinical adoption.

"Beyond Self-Consistency: Ensemble Reasoning Boosts Consistency and
  Accuracy of LLMs in Cancer Staging","  Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in
the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in
unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but
it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the
unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising
to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms.
Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning
process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of
the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model
performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple
reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with
the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open
access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage
from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach
is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in

to develop new, LLM-based methods for trustworthy medical knowledge synthesis,

Pharmacovigilance (PhV), where the significance and challenges lie in

commercial LLMs, in particular, are also capable of citing sources to support
their responses. In this paper, we ask: do the sources that LLMs generate
actually support the claims that they make? To answer this, we propose three
contributions. First, as expert medical annotations are an expensive and
time-consuming bottleneck for scalable evaluation, we demonstrate that GPT-4 is
highly accurate in validating source relevance, agreeing 88% of the time with a
panel of medical doctors. Second, we develop an end-to-end, automated pipeline
called \textit{SourceCheckup} and use it to evaluate five top-performing LLMs
on a dataset of 1200 generated questions, totaling over 40K pairs of statements
and sources. Interestingly, we find that between ~50% to 90% of LLM responses
are not fully supported by the sources they provide. We also evaluate GPT-4
with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and find that, even still, around
30\% of individual statements are unsupported, while nearly half of its
responses are not fully supported. Third, we open-source our curated dataset of
medical questions and expert annotations for future evaluations. Given the

improves the accuracy of entity probing, which asks whether a medical entities
is grounded by an image. We show that the improvements extend both to frequent
and rare entities, the latter of which may have less positive training data.
Downstream, we apply V-RAG with entity probing to correct hallucinations and
generate more clinically accurate X-ray reports, obtaining a higher RadGraph-F1
score.
