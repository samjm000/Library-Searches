significantly improved clinical predictive capabilities. Leveraging clinical
notes and multivariate time-series EHR, existing models often lack the medical
context relevent to clinical tasks, prompting the incorporation of external

KG knowledge have primarily focused on structured knowledge extraction,
neglecting unstructured data modalities and semantic high dimensional medical

(RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR representations that address
these limitations. Firstly, we apply Large Language Model (LLM) to encode long
context clinical notes and GRU model to encode time-series EHR data. Secondly,
we prompt LLM to extract task-relevant medical entities and match entities in
professionally labeled external knowledge graph (PrimeKG) with corresponding
medical knowledge. By matching and aligning with clinical standards, our
framework eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency. Lastly, we propose
an adaptive multimodal fusion network to integrate extracted knowledge with
multimodal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on MIMIC-III mortality and
readmission tasks showcase the superior performance of our REALM framework over
baselines, emphasizing the effectiveness of each module. REALM framework
contributes to refining the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare and
bridging the gap with nuanced medical context essential for informed clinical

RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in "Clarity" and
"Empathy," while achieving comparable scores in "Completeness" and

challenging due to the context-heavy nature of processing medical records.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution by facilitating
reasoning over large text sources. However, there are many parameters to
optimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation
study exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect
information retrieval for the clinical domain.
  Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record
(EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and
general-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf
decoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each
model, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.
  Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts
retrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model,
consistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models.
However, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and
query text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of
these models to guide future design of retrieval systems.
  Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query
formulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance
of these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new
domains. Further studies such as this one are vital for guiding
empirically-grounded development of retrieval frameworks, such as in the
context of RAG, for the clinical domain.

    abstract = {  Purpose: In radiology, large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, have
recently gained attention, and their utility is being rapidly evaluated.
However, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in clinical
applications due to limitations such as hallucinations and insufficient
referencing. To address these issues, we focus on the latest technology,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables LLMs to reference reliable
external knowledge (REK). Specifically, this study examines the utility and
reliability of a recently released RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for
staging lung cancer.
  Materials and methods: We summarized the current lung cancer staging
guideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We then tasked
NotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings
and evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we performed the same task using a
gold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), both with and without the REK.
  Results: NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer
staging experiment, outperforming GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the
REK and 25% without it. Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in
searching reference locations within the REK.
  Conclusion: NotebookLM successfully performed lung cancer staging by
utilizing the REK, demonstrating superior performance compared to GPT-4o.
Additionally, it provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK,
allowing radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's
responses and detect possible hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights
the potential of NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, in image diagnosis.

Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained
popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents
challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer
models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based
large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical
notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we
selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria
needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility
criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based
on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with
the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the
extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we
evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2

eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed
the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among
the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset.
Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this
study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising
scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid
of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.

prompts, where JSON data was converted to text via an LLM, summarized, and
mapped into graph structures representing key treatment relationships. Final
recommendations were generated by querying relevant graph summaries. Both were
evaluated using a set of patient descriptions, each with four associated
questions.
  As shown in Table 1, Agentic RAG achieved a 100% adherence (24/24) with no
hallucinations or incorrect treatments. Graph-RAG had 95.8% adherence (23/24)

healthcare due to the wide adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems.
The complexity of the medical text such as diverse length, mixed text types,
and full of medical jargon, poses a great challenge for developing effective
deep learning models. BERT has presented state-of-the-art results in many NLP
tasks, such as text classification and question answering. However, the
standalone BERT model cannot deal with the complexity of the medical text,
especially the lengthy clinical notes. Herein, we develop a new model called
KG-MTT-BERT (Knowledge Graph Enhanced Multi-Type Text BERT) by extending the
BERT model for long and multi-type text with the integration of the medical
knowledge graph. Our model can outperform all baselines and other
state-of-the-art models in diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification, which
requires comprehensive medical text for accurate classification. We also
demonstrated that our model can effectively handle multi-type text and the
integration of medical knowledge graph can significantly improve the
performance.

well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes
further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks

errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the
most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that
incorporating prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts
the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also
leads to increased output variance, resulting in notably divergent outputs even
when prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a
model-agnostic Soft Prompt-Based Calibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft
prompts to diminish variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based
summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs
indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively
curbs variance for various LLMs, providing a more uniform and dependable
solution for summarizing vital medical information.

contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical
assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult
critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods,
including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the
performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world
clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and
then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by
identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different
prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior
performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and
text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting
strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable
efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.
Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for

validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also
establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.

outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\%
improvement). For the TE task, Llama2-7B scored 79.45 (14.26\% improvement),
and MedAlpaca-7B achieved the highest F1 score of 93.45 (0.94\% improvement) on
the UC task. The ablation study revealed that while MTL increased efficiency
with a slight trade-off in performance, RAG significantly boosted overall
accuracy.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that
demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for
DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied
to other domains.

guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific
training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and
science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different
LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and systematic experimental study on prompt engineering for five
clinical NLP tasks: Clinical Sense Disambiguation, Biomedical Evidence
Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Medication Status Extraction, and
Medication Attribute Extraction. We assessed the prompts proposed in recent
literature, including simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, and
anticipatory prompts, and introduced two new types of prompts, namely heuristic
prompting and ensemble prompting. We evaluated the performance of these prompts
on three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-3.5, BARD, and LLAMA2. We also contrasted
zero-shot prompting with few-shot prompting, and provide novel insights and
guidelines for prompt engineering for LLMs in clinical NLP. To the best of our
knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of
different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of
generative AI, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in
this area.

KARE constructs a comprehensive multi-source KG by integrating biomedical

dense medical knowledge structuring approach enabling accurate retrieval of

patient contexts with focused, multi-faceted medical insights; and (3) a
reasoning-enhanced prediction framework that leverages these enriched contexts
to produce both accurate and interpretable clinical predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KARE outperforms leading models by up to
10.8-15.0% on MIMIC-III and 12.6-12.7% on MIMIC-IV for mortality and

histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research.
Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting
scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction
through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions
without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting
structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to
manual extraction by a trained human annotator.
  Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web
application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold
standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs
including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family,
which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111
histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study,
extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary.
  Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama
3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy
comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106,
respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p
<0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for
self-hosting.
  Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information
extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language.
Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing
standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate

tasks thanks to their promising performance in language understanding,
inference, and generation. It is then natural to test their feasibility in
solving the cohort recruitment task, which involves the classification of a
given paragraph of medical text into disease label(s). However, when applied to
knowledge-intensive problem settings such as medical text classification, where
the LLMs are expected to understand the decision made by human experts and
accurately identify the implied disease labels, the LLMs show a mediocre
performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text,
the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that
languages afford. To this end, we propose to use a knowledge graph as auxiliary
information to guide the LLMs in making predictions. Moreover, to further boost
the LLMs adapt to the problem setting, we apply a chain-of-thought (CoT) sample
selection strategy enhanced by reinforcement learning, which selects a set of
CoT samples given each individual medical report. Experimental results and

significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities.
Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can
estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has
historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this
paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge
acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models
to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning
models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the
patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.
Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI,
to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the
estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs
from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final
prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of
0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving
predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The
experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical
knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve
more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform
well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating
medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.

  Methods. We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts
across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot,
chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step prompting. The models were
benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores
available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact,
off-by-one, thresholded).
  Results. Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with
low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy
(0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature
parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ($\alpha = 0.98$ for GPT-4o).
CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to
specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items
independent of encounter phases and communication domains.
  Conclusion. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation
and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques.
Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a

    abstract = {  Generating physician letters is a time-consuming task in daily clinical
practice. This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models
(LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a
privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings
demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for
effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an
efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited
computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the
hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific
information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style.
ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the
8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician
evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has
limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it
successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories,
recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical
benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a
4-point scale). With careful physician review and correction, automated
LLM-based physician letter generation has significant practical value.

  Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and
tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses
evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text
using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing
these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques
and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for
vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss
metrics. Human-generated answers, provided by junior doctors, were used as a
comparison.
  Results: The LLM-RAG model generated answers within an average of 15-20
seconds, significantly faster than the 10 minutes typically required by humans.
Among the basic LLMs, GPT4.0 exhibited the best accuracy of 80.1%. This
accuracy was further increased to 91.4% when the model was enhanced with RAG.
Compared to the human-generated instructions, which had an accuracy of 86.3%,
the performance of the GPT4.0 RAG model demonstrated non-inferiority (p=0.610).
  Conclusions: In this case study, we demonstrated a LLM-RAG model for

medical and surgical sub-disciplines, against a human expert panel derived
ground truth. We compared performance for under 2 different CDSS practical
healthcare integration modalities: LLM-based CDSS alone (fully autonomous mode)
vs junior pharmacist + LLM-based CDSS (co-pilot, assistive mode).
  Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a RAG model with
state-of-the-art medically-related LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0 and Med-PaLM 2),
this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex
clinical vignettes across 12 different medical and surgical specialties. A
multidisciplinary expert panel assessed these cases for Drug-Related Problems
(DRPs) using the PCNE classification and graded severity / potential for harm

  Results RAG-LLM performed better compared to LLM alone. When employed in a

    author = {Alan B McMillan},
    abstract = {  Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.
  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical
MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned
nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety.
Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and
Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1,
smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the
LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an
automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct
answers, was the primary outcome.
  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy
(94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored
88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source
models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to
several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and
Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History,
and Artifacts and Corrections.
  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI
questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice.
These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical
environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and
integrate them into MRI workflows.

self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation
enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing
medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history
terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes
extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,
while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA
coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and
excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN
demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC
Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common
medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based
deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably
enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this
cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o,
reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding

However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is

to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an
alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist
capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.
This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical

helpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently
referencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides
evidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to

enables them to function as specialist, patient-tailored clinical assistants.
It also simplifies regulatory compliance by allowing each component tool to be

    abstract = {  Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks.
However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on
structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the
numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM
reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data
(e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is
often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This
ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical
nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain
expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by
synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an
unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as
original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a
better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small
model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This
process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for
continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain
tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to
OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to
linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for
tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs
appear.

available in electronic health records. Our method uses the idea of a
classification model explainer to generate questions and answers about medical
concepts corresponding to medical codes. In an expert evaluation with two
physicians, our method identifies $2.2\times$ more semantic matches and
$3.8\times$ more clinical abbreviations than two popular approaches that use
sentence transformers to create QA pairs. In an ML evaluation, adding our QA
pairs improves performance of GPT-4 as an extractive QA model, including on
difficult questions. In both the expert and ML evaluations, we examine
trade-offs between our method and sentence transformers for QA pair generation
depending on question difficulty.

outperforms Zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and self-consistency

physicians in determining eligibility for clinical trials based on a patient's
summarised medical profile. Using a prompting strategy combining one-shot,
selection-inference and chain-of-thought techniques, we investigate the
performance of LLMs on 10 synthetically created patient profiles. Performance
is evaluated at four levels: ability to identify screenable eligibility
criteria from a trial given a medical profile; ability to classify for each
individual criterion whether the patient qualifies; the overall classification
whether a patient is eligible for a clinical trial and the percentage of
criteria to be screened by physician. We evaluated against 146 clinical trials
and a total of 4,135 eligibility criteria. The LLM was able to correctly
identify the screenability of 72% (2,994/4,135) of the criteria. Additionally,
72% (341/471) of the screenable criteria were evaluated correctly. The
resulting trial level classification as eligible or ineligible resulted in a
recall of 0.5. By leveraging LLMs with a physician-in-the-loop, a recall of 1.0
and precision of 0.71 on clinical trial level can be achieved while reducing
the amount of criteria to be checked by an estimated 90%. LLMs can be used to
assist physicians with pre-screening of patients for clinical trials. By
forcing instruction-tuned LLMs to produce chain-of-thought responses, the
reasoning can be made transparent to and the decision process becomes amenable
by physicians, thereby making such a system feasible for use in real-world

    abstract = {  Background: Large language models (LLMs) have seen extraordinary advances
with applications in clinical decision support. However, high-quality evidence
is urgently needed on the potential and limitation of LLMs in providing
accurate clinical decisions based on real-world medical data. Objective: To
evaluate quantitatively whether universal state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT and
GPT-4) can predict the incidence risk of myocardial infarction (MI) with
logical inference, and to further make comparison between various models to
assess the performance of LLMs comprehensively. Methods: In this retrospective
cohort study, 482,310 participants recruited from 2006 to 2010 were initially
included in UK Biobank database and later on resampled into a final cohort of
690 participants. For each participant, tabular data of the risk factors of MI
were transformed into standardized textual descriptions for ChatGPT
recognition. Responses were generated by asking ChatGPT to select a score
ranging from 0 to 10 representing the risk. Chain of Thought (CoT) questioning
was used to evaluate whether LLMs make prediction logically. The predictive
performance of ChatGPT was compared with published medical indices, traditional
machine learning models and other large language models. Conclusions: Current
LLMs are not ready to be applied in clinical medicine fields. Future medical
LLMs are suggested to be expert in medical domain knowledge to understand both
natural languages and quantified medical data, and further make logical
inferences.

instruction-following dataset that integrates various task-specific datasets in
a conversational format. As a result, the model supports multiple tasks such as
medical report generation (MRG), visual grounding, and visual question
answering (VQA). M4CXR achieves state-of-the-art clinical accuracy in MRG by
employing a chain-of-thought prompting strategy, in which it identifies
findings in CXR images and subsequently generates corresponding reports. The
model is adaptable to various MRG scenarios depending on the available inputs,
such as single-image, multi-image, and multi-study contexts. In addition to
MRG, M4CXR performs visual grounding at a level comparable to specialized
models and also demonstrates outstanding performance in VQA. Both quantitative
and qualitative assessments reveal M4CXR's versatility in MRG, visual
grounding, and VQA, while consistently maintaining clinical accuracy.

clinical decision-making processes. While these models play an increasingly
prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in
healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on
patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like
architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases? To
answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three
question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient
descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations. We employ red-teaming
strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both
general-purpose and clinically-trained models. Our extensive experiments reveal
various disparities (some significant) across protected groups. We also observe
several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily
less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better
than the general-purpose models. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact
of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can
influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought)
can reduce biased outcomes effectively. Consistent with prior studies, we call
on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical

to its critical role in delivering tailored, patient-specific medications that
can greatly improve treatment outcomes. In addition, we compare the performance
of open-source models with proprietary models in settings with and without

10, 2024. Peer-reviewed journal and conference articles that discussed the
application of LLMs in critical care settings were included. From an initial
619 articles, 24 were selected for final review. This review grouped
applications of LLMs in CCM into three categories: clinical decision support,
medical documentation and reporting, and medical education and doctor-patient
communication. LLMs have advantages in handling unstructured data and do not
require manual feature engineering. Meanwhile, applying LLMs to CCM faces
challenges, including hallucinations, poor interpretability, bias and alignment
challenges, and privacy and ethics issues. Future research should enhance model
reliability and interpretability, integrate up-to-date medical knowledge, and
strengthen privacy and ethical guidelines. As LLMs evolve, they could become
key tools in CCM to help improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare

clinicians, and policymakers to understand the current status and future
potentials of LLMs in CCM.

Natural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this
data. Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
BERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many
applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word
sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically
generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are
language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical
NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity
recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure
robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and
standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and
standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures
concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is
time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can
prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical
Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are
popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture
concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest
source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing
with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and
procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best
solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs
for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same
functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.

domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize
84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess

    abstract = {  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the strong potential to assist
both clinicians and the general public with their extensive medical knowledge.
However, their application in healthcare is constrained due to concerns about
the privacy of data used in training, which prevents the integration of private
and personal information because of security and ethical issues. Moreover, if
their capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to access
up-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Information
retrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder their
effectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we address
this challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP).
Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of
LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process,
RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function that
permits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medical
records, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35%
additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation for
the question-answering task.

and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2
concept extraction shared task, and (2) identifying nervous system
disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse

developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline

healthcare professionals to quickly and clearly understand the context of

considerable promise in various domains, including medical diagnosis. Rare

this context, recent news such as "ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a 4-year-old's

systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on 4 critical dimensions
within the realm of rare diseases. Meanwhile, we have compiled the largest
open-source dataset on rare disease patients, establishing a benchmark for
future studies in this domain. To facilitate differential diagnosis of rare
diseases, we develop a dynamic few-shot prompt methodology, leveraging a
comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph synthesized from multiple knowledge
bases, significantly enhancing LLMs' diagnostic performance. Moreover, we
present an exhaustive comparative study of GPT-4's diagnostic capabilities
against those of specialist physicians. Our experimental findings underscore

collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the

    abstract = {  Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through
continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works
typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on
various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In
this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their
corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs
and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models
in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical
question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the
3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of
cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly
worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i)
comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing
the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii)
accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest
that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen
the conclusions of future studies.

LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published

more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their

In this paper we present a completely automated method MedPromptExtract to

The source of data was Discharge Summaries (DS) from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani
Hospital (KDAH) of patients having Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). A pre-existing
tool EIGEN which leverages semi-supervised learning techniques for
high-fidelity information extraction was used to anonymize the DS, Natural
Language Processing (NLP) was used to extract data from regular fields. We used
Prompt Engineering and Large Language Model(LLM) to extract custom clinical
information from free flowing text describing the patients stay in the
hospital. Twelve features associated with occurrence of AKI were extracted. The
LLM responses were validated against clinicians annotations. Results: The
MedPromptExtracttool first subjected DS to the anonymization pipeline which
took three seconds per summary. Successful anonymization was verified by
clinicians, thereafter NLP pipeline extracted structured text from the
anonymized pdfs at the rate of 0.2 seconds per summary with 100%
accuracy.Finally DS were analysed by the LLM pipeline using Gemini Pro for the
twelve features. Accuracy metrics were calculated by comparing model responses
to clinicians annotations with seven features achieving AUCs above 0.9,
indicating high fidelity of the extraction process. Conclusion:
MedPromptExtract serves as an automated adaptable tool for efficient data
extraction from medical records with a dynamic user interface. Keywords:

validate diabetes-specific LLMs. We first developed a comprehensive data

understanding and processing various diabetes tasks compared to other LLMs.
Furthermore, clinical studies showed the potential applications of our models
in diabetes care, including providing personalized healthcare, assisting

even fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that
can include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus,
and specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the
answers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external
knowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and
conduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down
potentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured
knowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent
representations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This
distinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent
representations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for
extraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those
triplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3)
sorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving
associated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM
with background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product
recommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this
approach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable
background information from information retrieval, but also improves
performance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper

biomedical data (e.g., texts, imaging, omics, and clinical) to provide
diagnosis and treatment recommendations for cancerous conditions.~Data and
knowledge about biomedical entities like cancer, drugs, genes, proteins, and
their mechanism is spread across structured (knowledge bases (KBs)) and
unstructured (e.g., scientific articles) sources. A large-scale knowledge graph
(KG) can be constructed by integrating and extracting facts about semantically
interrelated entities and relations. Such a KG not only allows exploration and
question answering (QA) but also enables domain experts to deduce new
knowledge. However, exploring and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for
non-domain users due to their lack of understanding of the data assets and
semantic technologies. In this paper, we develop a domain KG to leverage
cancer-specific biomarker discovery and interactive QA. For this, we
constructed a domain ontology called OncoNet Ontology (ONO), which enables
semantic reasoning for validating gene-disease (different types of cancer)
relations. The KG is further enriched by harmonizing the ONO, metadata,
controlled vocabularies, and biomedical concepts from scientific articles by
employing BioBERT- and SciBERT-based information extractors. Further, since the
biomedical domain is evolving, where new findings often replace old ones,
without having access to up-to-date scientific findings, there is a high chance
an AI system exhibits concept drift while providing diagnosis and treatment.
Therefore, we fine-tune the KG using large language models (LLMs) based on more
recent articles and KBs.

  Patient Perspectives},

    abstract = {  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing scenarios, particularly in simulating domain-specific experts
using tailored prompts. This ability enables LLMs to adopt the persona of
individuals with specific backgrounds, offering a cost-effective and efficient
alternative to traditional, resource-intensive user studies. By mimicking human
behavior, LLMs can anticipate responses based on concrete demographic or
professional profiles. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in
simulating individuals with diverse backgrounds and analyze the consistency of
these simulated behaviors compared to real-world outcomes. In particular, we
explore the potential of LLMs to interpret and respond to discharge summaries
provided to patients leaving the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We evaluate and
compare with human responses the comprehensibility of discharge summaries among
individuals with varying educational backgrounds, using this analysis to assess
the strengths and limitations of LLM-driven simulations. Notably, when LLMs are
primed with educational background information, they deliver accurate and
actionable medical guidance 88% of the time. However, when other information is
provided, performance significantly drops, falling below random chance levels.
This preliminary study shows the potential benefits and pitfalls of
automatically generating patient-specific health information from diverse
populations. While LLMs show promise in simulating health personas, our results
highlight critical gaps that must be addressed before they can be reliably used
in clinical settings. Our findings suggest that a straightforward
query-response model could outperform a more tailored approach in delivering
health information. This is a crucial first step in understanding how LLMs can
be optimized for personalized health communication while maintaining accuracy.

various general language tasks, its performance in specialized fields such as
medicine remains unknown. To this end, this report provides a comprehensive
exploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, examining 3 key aspects:
understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. Specifically, our evaluation
encompasses 6 tasks using data from 37 medical datasets, including two newly
constructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on
professional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)
and The Lancet. These datasets offer greater clinical relevance compared to
standard medical QA benchmarks such as MedQA, translating more effectively into
real-world clinical utility. Our analysis of o1 suggests that the enhanced
reasoning ability of LLMs may (significantly) benefit their capability to
understand various medical instructions and reason through complex clinical
scenarios. Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy by an average
of 6.2% and 6.6% across 19 datasets and two newly created complex QA scenarios.
But meanwhile, we identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and
the existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent
multilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation. We release our raw

also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond
measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the
influence of test questions containing both text and images on model
performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study
probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes
applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any
specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20
points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as
models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned
version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better
calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the
likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the
model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to
explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and

Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in

user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data
incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which
employs long narrative prompts.
  Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors,
including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient
records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional
clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot
and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when
employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as
sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased
number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the
performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior
cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models.
  This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored
communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes.
The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training

sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the
tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10
codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on
these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors'
notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to
investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to
explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B,
Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks.
Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion
parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not
display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than
urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which
demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor
documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor
documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal
balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning
and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for
clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available

study, we introduce an LLM optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its
ability to generate a DDx alone or as an aid to clinicians. 20 clinicians
evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from the New
England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) case reports. Each case report was read by
two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: either
assistance from search engines and standard medical resources, or LLM
assistance in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline,
unassisted DDx prior to using the respective assistive tools. Our LLM for DDx
exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians
(top-10 accuracy 59.1% vs 33.6%, [p = 0.04]). Comparing the two assisted study
arms, the DDx quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by our LLM
(top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared to clinicians without its assistance (36.1%)
(McNemar's Test: 45.7, p < 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%) (4.75, p =

differential lists than those without its assistance. Our study suggests that
our LLM for DDx has potential to improve clinicians' diagnostic reasoning and

explore whether the most popular large language model, ChatGPT, can extract

of ChatGPT to obtain the responses. A post-processing module is developed to
transform the responses into structured extraction results. We conducted the

this step by proposing an agentic workflow with the Reflexion framework, which

answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven
public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models,
arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical
LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot
prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance,
across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical
LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical)
tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in
the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each
medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii)
optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for
statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not
consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they
substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art

explore their application to trial matching. First, we design an LLM-based

evaluates whether that patient meets a set of inclusion criteria (also

patients an order of magnitude faster and more cheaply than the status quo, and
develop a two-stage retrieval pipeline that reduces the number of tokens
processed by up to a third while retaining high performance. Third, we evaluate
the interpretability of our system by having clinicians evaluate the natural

achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.0604. In contrast, LLMs without
fine-tuning exhibit poor performance. Although LLMs have demonstrated
wide-ranging capabilities, our work underscores the necessity of fine-tuning
for TCM prescription prediction and presents an effective way to accomplish
this.

generating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories. Two user

clinical utility of the generated sequences. MVG has the potential to assist
healthcare providers in modeling disease trajectories, interpolating missing

    abstract = {  Background: Machine learning methods for clinical named entity recognition
and entity normalization systems can utilize both labeled corpora and Knowledge
Graphs (KGs) for learning. However, infrequently occurring concepts may have
few mentions in training corpora and lack detailed descriptions or synonyms,
even in large KGs. For Disease Entity Recognition (DER) and Disease Entity
Normalization (DEN), this can result in fewer high quality training examples
relative to the number of known diseases. Large Language Model (LLM) generation
of synthetic training examples could improve performance in these information
extraction tasks.
  Methods: We fine-tuned a LLaMa-2 13B Chat LLM to generate a synthetic corpus
containing normalized mentions of concepts from the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) Disease Semantic Group. We measured overall and Out of
Distribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data
augmentation. We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4
different data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and
SapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.
  Results: Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all
3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by
3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data. A small
improvement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only
one dataset showed OOD improvement.
  Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN
relative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data
with synthetic mentions. Ablation studies indicate that performance gains for
DEN were only partially attributable to improvements in OOD performance. The
same approach has only a limited ability to improve DER. We make our software
and dataset publicly available.

margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods
or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically
designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical
multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support,
multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization.
Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric
designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system
that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a
granular assessment of potential clinical impacts. We also present
MediHallDetector, a novel Medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination

Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish baselines for popular
LVLMs using our benchmark. The findings indicate that MediHall Score provides a
more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional

this work can significantly improve the reliability of LVLMs in medical

prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language

deep learning models for concept extraction and end-to-end relation extraction
using two benchmark datasets developed by the 2018 National NLP Clinical

focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses. Second, the
frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm
the critical abnormal information. Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest
X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional
nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs. Recently,
LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate

paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report
generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts.
Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with
perceiver to extract the visual information. To tailor the LLM for report
generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic
information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated
during training to capture common disease representations. Furthermore, we

communicating information across various health systems. Current approaches
tend to work well on specific medical domains but generalize poorly to unseen
sub-specialties. This is of increasing concern under a public health crisis as
new medical conditions and drug treatments come to light frequently. Zero-shot
retrieval is challenging due to the high degree of ambiguity and variability in
medical corpora, making it difficult to build an accurate similarity measure
between mentions and concepts. Medical knowledge graphs (KG), however, contain
rich semantics including large numbers of synonyms as well as its curated
graphical structures. To take advantage of this valuable information, we
propose a suite of learning tasks designed for training efficient zero-shot
entity retrieval models. Without requiring any human annotation, our knowledge
graph enriched architecture significantly outperforms common zero-shot
benchmarks including BM25 and Clinical BERT with 7% to 30% higher recall across
multiple major medical ontologies, such as UMLS, SNOMED, and ICD-10.

rehabilitation exercise information from the clinical notes of post-stroke
patients treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A cohort of
13,605 patients diagnosed with stroke was identified, and their clinical notes
containing rehabilitation therapy notes were retrieved. A comprehensive
clinical ontology was created to represent various aspects of physical
rehabilitation exercises. State-of-the-art NLP algorithms were then developed
and compared, including rule-based, machine learning-based algorithms, and
large language model (LLM)-based algorithms (ChatGPT). Analysis was conducted
on a dataset comprising 23,724 notes with detailed demographic and clinical
characteristics. The rule-based NLP algorithm demonstrated superior performance
in most areas, particularly in detecting the 'Right Side' location with an F1
score of 0.975, outperforming Gradient Boosting by 0.063. Gradient Boosting
excelled in 'Lower Extremity' location detection (F1 score: 0.978), surpassing
rule-based NLP by 0.023. It also showed notable performance in 'Passive Range
of Motion' with an F1 score of 0.970, a 0.032 improvement over rule-based NLP.
The rule-based algorithm efficiently handled 'Duration', 'Sets', and 'Reps'
with F1 scores up to 0.65. LLM-based NLP, particularly ChatGPT with few-shot
prompts, achieved high recall but generally lower precision and F1 scores.
However, it notably excelled in 'Backward Plane' motion detection, achieving an
F1 score of 0.846, surpassing the rule-based algorithm's 0.720.

we verbalize the extracted content into a report that matches the style of a

requires the LMs not to only understand the patients' long clinical documents,

instructional information provided both to carers and to the patient at the
time of discharge. The proposed Re$^3$Writer imitates the working patterns of
physicians to first \textbf{re}trieve related working experience from
historical instructions written by physicians, then \textbf{re}ason related
medical knowledge. Finally, it \textbf{re}fines the retrieved working

is used to generate the discharge instructions for previously-unseen patients.
Our experiments show that, using our method, the performance of five

enhances the degree of freedom and flexibility but increases drastically the
complexity of the optimization. In inverse planning optimization the dose
contribution for all potential beam directions is usually pre-calculates and
pre-loads into the Treatment Planning System (TPS). The size the dose matrix
becomes more critical when moving from coplanar IMRT to non-coplanar IMRT since
the number of beams increases drastically. A solution would be to calculate
"on-the-fly" the dose contribution to each new candidate beam during
optimization. This is only possible if a dose calculation engine is fast enough
to be used online during optimization iterations, which is not the case in
standard method. Therefore, in this work we propose an IMRT optimization scheme
using deep learning based dose engine to compute the dose matrix on-line. The
proposed deep learning approach will be combined into a
simulated-annealing-based optimization method for non-coplanar IMRT. Since the
dose engine will compute the dose contribution on-line during the optimization,
the final main optimization method requires to keep in memory a very

advantage of the proposed method was the reduction of the memory storage from

years worldwide, imposing a substantial burden on affected families. Currently,
there are three significant hurdles in diagnosing and treating pediatric

respiratory diseases, making rapid and accurate differential diagnosis
challenging. Secondly, primary hospitals often lack sufficient medical
resources and experienced doctors. Lastly, providing personalized diagnostic
reports and treatment recommendations is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
tackle these challenges, we proposed a Medical Multimodal Large Language Model
for Pediatric Pneumonia (P2Med-MLLM). It was capable of handling diverse
clinical tasks, such as generating free-text radiology reports and medical
records within a unified framework. Specifically, P2Med-MLLM can process both
pure text and image-text data, trained on an extensive and large-scale dataset
(P2Med-MD), including real clinical information from 163,999 outpatient and
8,684 inpatient cases. This dataset comprised 2D chest X-ray images, 3D chest
CT images, corresponding radiology reports, and outpatient and inpatient
records. We designed a three-stage training strategy to enable P2Med-MLLM to
comprehend medical knowledge and follow instructions for various clinical
tasks. To rigorously evaluate P2Med-MLLM's performance, we developed
P2Med-MBench, a benchmark consisting of 642 meticulously verified samples by
pediatric pulmonology specialists, covering six clinical decision-support tasks
and a balanced variety of diseases. The automated scoring results demonstrated
the superiority of P2Med-MLLM. This work plays a crucial role in assisting

radiology report generation that learns generalizable representations and
provides a basis pattern for model adaptation in sophisticated analysts' cases.
Specifically, ChatRadio-Valuer is trained based on the radiology reports from a
single institution by means of supervised fine-tuning, and then adapted to
disease diagnosis tasks for human multi-system evaluation (i.e., chest,
abdomen, muscle-skeleton, head, and maxillofacial $\&$ neck) from six different
institutions in clinical-level events. The clinical dataset utilized in this
study encompasses a remarkable total of \textbf{332,673} observations. From the
comprehensive results on engineering indicators, clinical efficacy and
deployment cost metrics, it can be shown that ChatRadio-Valuer consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art models, especially ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) and

fine-tuning GPT-4o with only MIMIC-CXR data for the same task, MedImageInsight
outperforms in clinical metrics, but underperforms on lexical metrics where
GPT-4o sets a new SOTA. Importantly for regulatory purposes, MedImageInsight
can generate ROC curves, adjust sensitivity and specificity based on clinical

and federated queries. However, exploration and querying large-scale KGs is
tedious for certain groups of users due to a lack of knowledge about underlying
data assets or semantic technologies. Such a KG will not only allow deducing
new knowledge and question answering(QA) but also allows domain experts to
explore. Since cross-disciplinary explanations are important for accurate
diagnosis, it is important to query the KG to provide interactive explanations
about learned biomarkers. Inspired by these, we construct a domain-specific KG,
particularly for cancer-specific biomarker discovery. The KG is constructed by
integrating cancer-related knowledge and facts from multiple sources. First, we
construct a domain-specific ontology, which we call OncoNet Ontology (ONO). The
ONO ontology is developed to enable semantic reasoning for verification of the
predictions for relations between diseases and genes. The KG is then developed
and enriched by harmonizing the ONO, additional metadata schemas, ontologies,
controlled vocabularies, and additional concepts from external sources using a
BERT-based information extraction method. BioBERT and SciBERT are finetuned
with the selected articles crawled from PubMed. We listed down some queries and
some examples of QA and deducing knowledge based on the KG.

    abstract = {  Background : Knowledge is evolving over time, often as a result of new
discoveries or changes in the adopted methods of reasoning. Also, new facts or
evidence may become available, leading to new understandings of complex
phenomena. This is particularly true in the biomedical field, where scientists
and physicians are constantly striving to find new methods of diagnosis,
treatment and eventually cure. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a real way of
organizing and retrieving the massive and growing amount of biomedical
knowledge.
  Objective : We propose an end-to-end approach for knowledge extraction and
analysis from biomedical clinical notes using the Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and Conditional Random Field
(CRF) layer.
  Methods : The approach is based on knowledge graphs, which can effectively
process abstract biomedical concepts such as relationships and interactions
between medical entities. Besides offering an intuitive way to visualize these
concepts, KGs can solve more complex knowledge retrieval problems by
simplifying them into simpler representations or by transforming the problems
into representations from different perspectives. We created a biomedical
Knowledge Graph using using Natural Language Processing models for named entity
recognition and relation extraction. The generated biomedical knowledge graphs
(KGs) are then used for question answering.
  Results : The proposed framework can successfully extract relevant structured
information with high accuracy (90.7% for Named-entity recognition (NER), 88%
for relation extraction (RE)), according to experimental findings based on
real-world 505 patient biomedical unstructured clinical notes.
  Conclusions : In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end system for the
construction of a biomedical knowledge graph from clinical textual using a
variation of BERT models.

of accuracy, both the lack of interpretability and limitations to transfer

the underlying relationships among clinical terms, achieving a representation
that is better understandable for clinicians and clinically more accurate,

embedding on two tasks namely disease classification of X-ray reports and image
classification. For disease classification our model is competitive with its
BERT-based counterparts, while being magnitudes smaller in size and training
data requirements. For image classification, we show the effectiveness of the
graph embedding leveraging cross-modal knowledge transfer and show how this

addresses the lack of valuable concept annotations by eliciting knowledge from

rule-verifiable reasoning chains. Each reasoning step is assigned an evolution
rollout value, allowing verified trajectories to train the policy model and the
process reward model (PRM). During inference, the policy model generates

various applications, including assisting with clinical decision-making as
demonstrated by strong performance of large language models on medical
licensure exams. However, their ability to solve complex, open-ended cases,
which may be representative of clinical practice, remains unexplored. Methods:
In this study, the accuracy of large language AI models GPT4 and GPT3.5 in
diagnosing complex clinical cases was investigated using published Case Records
of the Massachusetts General Hospital. A total of 50 cases requiring a
diagnosis and diagnostic test published from January 1, 2022 to April 16, 2022
were identified. For each case, models were given a prompt requesting the top
three specific diagnoses and associated diagnostic tests, followed by case
text, labs, and figure legends. Model outputs were assessed in comparison to
the final clinical diagnosis and whether the model-predicted test would result
in a correct diagnosis. Results: GPT4 and GPT3.5 accurately provided the
correct diagnosis in 26% and 22% of cases in one attempt, and 46% and 42%
within three attempts, respectively. GPT4 and GPT3.5 provided a correct
essential diagnostic test in 28% and 24% of cases in one attempt, and 44% and

demonstrate potential usefulness in generating differential diagnoses but
remain limited in their ability to provide a single unifying diagnosis in
complex, open-ended cases. Future research should focus on evaluating model
performance in larger datasets of open-ended clinical challenges and exploring
potential human-AI collaboration strategies to enhance clinical

evaluate them in a static, single-turn format, posing reliability concerns in

trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context or insufficient
knowledge. In this paper, we propose to change the static paradigm to an
interactive one, develop systems that proactively ask questions to gather more
information and respond reliably, and introduce an benchmark - MediQ - to
evaluate question-asking ability in LLMs. MediQ simulates clinical interactions
consisting of a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System; with potentially
incomplete initial information, the Expert refrains from making diagnostic
decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details via follow-up
questions. We provide a pipeline to convert single-turn medical benchmarks into
an interactive format. Our results show that directly prompting
state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades performance, indicating that
adapting LLMs to proactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial. We
experiment with abstention strategies to better estimate model confidence and
decide when to ask questions, improving diagnostic accuracy by 22.3%; however,
performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound
with complete information upfront. Further analyses show improved interactive
performance with filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations.
Overall, we introduce a novel problem towards LLM reliability, an interactive
MediQ benchmark and a novel question-asking system, and highlight directions to
extend LLMs' information-seeking abilities in critical domains.

    abstract = {  Early diagnosis and professional intervention can help children with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) return to normal life. However, the scarcity and
imbalance of professional medical resources currently prevent many autistic
children from receiving the necessary diagnosis and intervention. Therefore,
numerous paradigms have been proposed that use computer technology to assist or
independently conduct ASD interventions, with the aim of alleviating the
aforementioned problem. However, these paradigms often lack a foundation in
clinical intervention methods and suffer from a lack of personalization.
Addressing these concerns, we propose ASD-Chat, a social intervention system
based on VB-MAPP (Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program)
and powered by ChatGPT as the backbone for dialogue generation. Specifically,
we designed intervention paradigms and prompts based on the clinical
intervention method VB-MAPP and utilized ChatGPT's generative capabilities to
facilitate social dialogue interventions. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed system achieves competitive intervention effects to those of
professional interventionists, making it a promising tool for long-term
interventions in real healthcare scenario in the future.

    abstract = {  Background: Tumor segmentation in MRI is crucial in radiotherapy (RT)
treatment planning for brain tumor patients. Segment anything (SA), a novel
promptable foundation model for autosegmentation, has shown high accuracy for
multiple segmentation tasks but was not evaluated on medical datasets yet.
Methods: SA was evaluated in a point-to-mask task for glioma brain tumor
autosegmentation on 16744 transversal slices from 369 MRI datasets (BraTS
2020). Up to 9 point prompts were placed per slice. Tumor core (enhancing tumor
+ necrotic core) was segmented on contrast-enhanced T1w sequences. Out of the 3
masks predicted by SA, accuracy was evaluated for the mask with the highest
calculated IoU (oracle mask) and with highest model predicted IoU (suggested
mask). In addition to assessing SA on whole MRI slices, SA was also evaluated
on images cropped to the tumor (max. 3D extent + 2 cm). Results: Mean best IoU
(mbIoU) using oracle mask on full MRI slices was 0.762 (IQR 0.713-0.917). Best
2D mask was achieved after a mean of 6.6 point prompts (IQR 5-9). Segmentation
accuracy was significantly better for high- compared to low-grade glioma cases
(mbIoU 0.789 vs. 0.668). Accuracy was worse using MRI slices cropped to the
tumor (mbIoU 0.759) and was much worse using suggested mask (full slices
0.572). For all experiments, accuracy was low on peripheral slices with few
tumor voxels (mbIoU, <300: 0.537 vs. >=300: 0.841). Stacking best oracle
segmentations from full axial MRI slices, mean 3D DSC for tumor core was 0.872,
which was improved to 0.919 by combining axial, sagittal and coronal masks.
Conclusions: The Segment Anything foundation model, while trained on photos,
can achieve high zero-shot accuracy for glioma brain tumor segmentation on MRI
slices. The results suggest that Segment Anything can accelerate and facilitate
RT treatment planning, when properly integrated in a clinical application.

    abstract = {  In brain neural networks, Local Field Potential (LFP) signals represent the
dynamic flow of information. Analyzing LFP clinical data plays a critical role
in improving our understanding of brain mechanisms. One way to enhance our
understanding of these mechanisms is to identify a global model to predict
brain signals in different situations. This paper identifies a global
data-driven based on LFP recordings of the Nucleus Accumbens and Hippocampus
regions in freely moving rats. The LFP is recorded from each rat in two
different situations: before and after the process of getting a reward which
can be either a drug (Morphine) or natural food (like popcorn or biscuit). A
comparison of five machine learning methods including Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM), Echo State Network (ESN), Deep Echo State Network (DeepESN), Radial
Basis Function (RBF), and Local Linear Model Tree (LLM) is conducted to develop
this model. LoLiMoT was chosen with the best performance among all methods.
This model can predict the future states of these regions with one pre-trained
model. Identifying this model showed that Morphine and natural rewards do not
change the dynamic features of neurons in these regions.
