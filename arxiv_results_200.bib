significantly improved clinical predictive capabilities. Leveraging clinical
notes and multivariate time-series EHR, existing models often lack the medical
context relevent to clinical tasks, prompting the incorporation of external

KG knowledge have primarily focused on structured knowledge extraction,
neglecting unstructured data modalities and semantic high dimensional medical
knowledge. In response, we propose REALM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR representations that address
these limitations. Firstly, we apply Large Language Model (LLM) to encode long
context clinical notes and GRU model to encode time-series EHR data. Secondly,
we prompt LLM to extract task-relevant medical entities and match entities in
professionally labeled external knowledge graph (PrimeKG) with corresponding
medical knowledge. By matching and aligning with clinical standards, our
framework eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency. Lastly, we propose
an adaptive multimodal fusion network to integrate extracted knowledge with
multimodal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on MIMIC-III mortality and
readmission tasks showcase the superior performance of our REALM framework over
baselines, emphasizing the effectiveness of each module. REALM framework
contributes to refining the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare and

challenging due to the context-heavy nature of processing medical records.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution by facilitating
reasoning over large text sources. However, there are many parameters to
optimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation
study exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect
information retrieval for the clinical domain.
  Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record
(EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and
general-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf
decoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each
model, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.
  Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts
retrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model,
consistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models.
However, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and
query text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of
these models to guide future design of retrieval systems.
  Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query
formulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance
of these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new
domains. Further studies such as this one are vital for guiding
empirically-grounded development of retrieval frameworks, such as in the
context of RAG, for the clinical domain.

    abstract = {  Purpose: In radiology, large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, have
recently gained attention, and their utility is being rapidly evaluated.
However, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in clinical
applications due to limitations such as hallucinations and insufficient
referencing. To address these issues, we focus on the latest technology,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables LLMs to reference reliable
external knowledge (REK). Specifically, this study examines the utility and
reliability of a recently released RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for
staging lung cancer.
  Materials and methods: We summarized the current lung cancer staging
guideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We then tasked
NotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings
and evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we performed the same task using a
gold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), both with and without the REK.
  Results: NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer
staging experiment, outperforming GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the
REK and 25% without it. Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in
searching reference locations within the REK.
  Conclusion: NotebookLM successfully performed lung cancer staging by
utilizing the REK, demonstrating superior performance compared to GPT-4o.
Additionally, it provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK,
allowing radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's
responses and detect possible hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights
the potential of NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, in image diagnosis.

Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained
popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents
challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer
models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based
large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical
notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we
selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria
needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility
criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based
on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with
the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the
extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we
evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2

eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed
the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among
the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset.
Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this
study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising
scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid
of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.

prompts, where JSON data was converted to text via an LLM, summarized, and
mapped into graph structures representing key treatment relationships. Final
recommendations were generated by querying relevant graph summaries. Both were
evaluated using a set of patient descriptions, each with four associated
questions.
  As shown in Table 1, Agentic RAG achieved a 100% adherence (24/24) with no
hallucinations or incorrect treatments. Graph-RAG had 95.8% adherence (23/24)

healthcare due to the wide adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems.
The complexity of the medical text such as diverse length, mixed text types,
and full of medical jargon, poses a great challenge for developing effective
deep learning models. BERT has presented state-of-the-art results in many NLP
tasks, such as text classification and question answering. However, the
standalone BERT model cannot deal with the complexity of the medical text,
especially the lengthy clinical notes. Herein, we develop a new model called
KG-MTT-BERT (Knowledge Graph Enhanced Multi-Type Text BERT) by extending the
BERT model for long and multi-type text with the integration of the medical
knowledge graph. Our model can outperform all baselines and other
state-of-the-art models in diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification, which
requires comprehensive medical text for accurate classification. We also
demonstrated that our model can effectively handle multi-type text and the
integration of medical knowledge graph can significantly improve the
performance.

well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes
further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks

errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the
most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that
incorporating prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts
the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also
leads to increased output variance, resulting in notably divergent outputs even
when prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a
model-agnostic Soft Prompt-Based Calibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft
prompts to diminish variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based
summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs
indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively
curbs variance for various LLMs, providing a more uniform and dependable
solution for summarizing vital medical information.

contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical
assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult
critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods,
including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the
performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world
clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and
then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by
identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different
prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior
performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and
text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting
strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable
efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.
Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for

validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also
establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.

outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\%
improvement). For the TE task, Llama2-7B scored 79.45 (14.26\% improvement),
and MedAlpaca-7B achieved the highest F1 score of 93.45 (0.94\% improvement) on
the UC task. The ablation study revealed that while MTL increased efficiency
with a slight trade-off in performance, RAG significantly boosted overall
accuracy.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that
demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for
DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied
to other domains.

guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific
training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and
science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different
LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and systematic experimental study on prompt engineering for five
clinical NLP tasks: Clinical Sense Disambiguation, Biomedical Evidence
Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Medication Status Extraction, and
Medication Attribute Extraction. We assessed the prompts proposed in recent
literature, including simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, and
anticipatory prompts, and introduced two new types of prompts, namely heuristic
prompting and ensemble prompting. We evaluated the performance of these prompts
on three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-3.5, BARD, and LLAMA2. We also contrasted
zero-shot prompting with few-shot prompting, and provide novel insights and
guidelines for prompt engineering for LLMs in clinical NLP. To the best of our
knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of
different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of
generative AI, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in
this area.

KARE constructs a comprehensive multi-source KG by integrating biomedical

dense medical knowledge structuring approach enabling accurate retrieval of

patient contexts with focused, multi-faceted medical insights; and (3) a
reasoning-enhanced prediction framework that leverages these enriched contexts
to produce both accurate and interpretable clinical predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KARE outperforms leading models by up to
10.8-15.0% on MIMIC-III and 12.6-12.7% on MIMIC-IV for mortality and

histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research.
Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting
scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction
through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions
without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting
structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to
manual extraction by a trained human annotator.
  Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web
application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold
standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs
including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family,
which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111
histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study,
extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary.
  Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama
3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy
comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106,
respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p
<0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for
self-hosting.
  Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information
extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language.
Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing
standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate

tasks thanks to their promising performance in language understanding,
inference, and generation. It is then natural to test their feasibility in
solving the cohort recruitment task, which involves the classification of a
given paragraph of medical text into disease label(s). However, when applied to
knowledge-intensive problem settings such as medical text classification, where
the LLMs are expected to understand the decision made by human experts and
accurately identify the implied disease labels, the LLMs show a mediocre
performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text,
the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that
languages afford. To this end, we propose to use a knowledge graph as auxiliary
information to guide the LLMs in making predictions. Moreover, to further boost
the LLMs adapt to the problem setting, we apply a chain-of-thought (CoT) sample
selection strategy enhanced by reinforcement learning, which selects a set of
CoT samples given each individual medical report. Experimental results and

significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities.
Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can
estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has
historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this
paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge
acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models
to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning
models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the
patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.
Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI,
to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the
estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs
from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final
prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of
0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving
predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The
experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical
knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve
more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform
well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating
medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.

  Methods. We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts
across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot,

benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores
available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact,
off-by-one, thresholded).
  Results. Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with
low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy
(0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature
parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ($\alpha = 0.98$ for GPT-4o).
CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to
specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items
independent of encounter phases and communication domains.
  Conclusion. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation
and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques.
Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a

    abstract = {  Generating physician letters is a time-consuming task in daily clinical
practice. This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models
(LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a
privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings
demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for
effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an
efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited
computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the
hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific
information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style.
ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the
8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician
evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has
limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it
successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories,
recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical
benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a
4-point scale). With careful physician review and correction, automated
LLM-based physician letter generation has significant practical value.

  Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and
tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses
evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text
using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing
these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques
and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for
vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss
metrics. Human-generated answers, provided by junior doctors, were used as a
comparison.
  Results: The LLM-RAG model generated answers within an average of 15-20
seconds, significantly faster than the 10 minutes typically required by humans.
Among the basic LLMs, GPT4.0 exhibited the best accuracy of 80.1%. This
accuracy was further increased to 91.4% when the model was enhanced with RAG.
Compared to the human-generated instructions, which had an accuracy of 86.3%,
the performance of the GPT4.0 RAG model demonstrated non-inferiority (p=0.610).
  Conclusions: In this case study, we demonstrated a LLM-RAG model for

  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based CDSS in correctly

medical and surgical sub-disciplines, against a human expert panel derived
ground truth. We compared performance for under 2 different CDSS practical
healthcare integration modalities: LLM-based CDSS alone (fully autonomous mode)
vs junior pharmacist + LLM-based CDSS (co-pilot, assistive mode).
  Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a RAG model with
state-of-the-art medically-related LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0 and Med-PaLM 2),
this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex
clinical vignettes across 12 different medical and surgical specialties. A
multidisciplinary expert panel assessed these cases for Drug-Related Problems
(DRPs) using the PCNE classification and graded severity / potential for harm
using revised NCC MERP medication error index. We compared.
  Results RAG-LLM performed better compared to LLM alone. When employed in a

  Conclusions This study established that a RAG-LLM based CDSS significantly

    author = {Alan B McMillan},
    abstract = {  Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.
  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical
MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned
nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety.
Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and
Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1,
smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the
LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an
automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct
answers, was the primary outcome.
  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy
(94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored
88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source
models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to
several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and
Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History,
and Artifacts and Corrections.
  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI
questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice.
These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical
environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and
integrate them into MRI workflows.

self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation
enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing
medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history
terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes
extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,
while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA
coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and
excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN
demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC
Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common
medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based
deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably
enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this
cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o,
reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding

However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is

to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an
alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist
capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.
This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical
AI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image

helpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently
referencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides
evidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to
retrieve or synthesize new information when used as autonomous agents. This
enables them to function as specialist, patient-tailored clinical assistants.
It also simplifies regulatory compliance by allowing each component tool to be

    abstract = {  Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks.
However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on
structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the
numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM
reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data
(e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is
often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This
ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical
nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain
expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by
synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an
unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as
original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a
better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small
model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This
process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for
continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain
tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to
OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to
linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for
tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs
appear.

our method with a system of agents designed solely by LLMs and other strong

outperforms Zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and self-consistency

physicians in determining eligibility for clinical trials based on a patient's
summarised medical profile. Using a prompting strategy combining one-shot,
selection-inference and chain-of-thought techniques, we investigate the
performance of LLMs on 10 synthetically created patient profiles. Performance
is evaluated at four levels: ability to identify screenable eligibility
criteria from a trial given a medical profile; ability to classify for each
individual criterion whether the patient qualifies; the overall classification
whether a patient is eligible for a clinical trial and the percentage of
criteria to be screened by physician. We evaluated against 146 clinical trials
and a total of 4,135 eligibility criteria. The LLM was able to correctly
identify the screenability of 72% (2,994/4,135) of the criteria. Additionally,
72% (341/471) of the screenable criteria were evaluated correctly. The
resulting trial level classification as eligible or ineligible resulted in a
recall of 0.5. By leveraging LLMs with a physician-in-the-loop, a recall of 1.0
and precision of 0.71 on clinical trial level can be achieved while reducing
the amount of criteria to be checked by an estimated 90%. LLMs can be used to
assist physicians with pre-screening of patients for clinical trials. By
forcing instruction-tuned LLMs to produce chain-of-thought responses, the
reasoning can be made transparent to and the decision process becomes amenable
by physicians, thereby making such a system feasible for use in real-world

    abstract = {  Background: Large language models (LLMs) have seen extraordinary advances
with applications in clinical decision support. However, high-quality evidence
is urgently needed on the potential and limitation of LLMs in providing
accurate clinical decisions based on real-world medical data. Objective: To
evaluate quantitatively whether universal state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT and
GPT-4) can predict the incidence risk of myocardial infarction (MI) with
logical inference, and to further make comparison between various models to
assess the performance of LLMs comprehensively. Methods: In this retrospective
cohort study, 482,310 participants recruited from 2006 to 2010 were initially
included in UK Biobank database and later on resampled into a final cohort of
690 participants. For each participant, tabular data of the risk factors of MI
were transformed into standardized textual descriptions for ChatGPT
recognition. Responses were generated by asking ChatGPT to select a score
ranging from 0 to 10 representing the risk. Chain of Thought (CoT) questioning
was used to evaluate whether LLMs make prediction logically. The predictive
performance of ChatGPT was compared with published medical indices, traditional
machine learning models and other large language models. Conclusions: Current
LLMs are not ready to be applied in clinical medicine fields. Future medical
LLMs are suggested to be expert in medical domain knowledge to understand both
natural languages and quantified medical data, and further make logical
inferences.

instruction-following dataset that integrates various task-specific datasets in
a conversational format. As a result, the model supports multiple tasks such as
medical report generation (MRG), visual grounding, and visual question

employing a chain-of-thought prompting strategy, in which it identifies
findings in CXR images and subsequently generates corresponding reports. The
model is adaptable to various MRG scenarios depending on the available inputs,
such as single-image, multi-image, and multi-study contexts. In addition to
MRG, M4CXR performs visual grounding at a level comparable to specialized
models and also demonstrates outstanding performance in VQA. Both quantitative
and qualitative assessments reveal M4CXR's versatility in MRG, visual
grounding, and VQA, while consistently maintaining clinical accuracy.

patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like
architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases? To
answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three

general-purpose and clinically-trained models. Our extensive experiments reveal
various disparities (some significant) across protected groups. We also observe
several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily
less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better
than the general-purpose models. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact
of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can
influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought)
can reduce biased outcomes effectively. Consistent with prior studies, we call
on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical

10, 2024. Peer-reviewed journal and conference articles that discussed the
application of LLMs in critical care settings were included. From an initial
619 articles, 24 were selected for final review. This review grouped
applications of LLMs in CCM into three categories: clinical decision support,
medical documentation and reporting, and medical education and doctor-patient
communication. LLMs have advantages in handling unstructured data and do not
require manual feature engineering. Meanwhile, applying LLMs to CCM faces
challenges, including hallucinations, poor interpretability, bias and alignment
challenges, and privacy and ethics issues. Future research should enhance model
reliability and interpretability, integrate up-to-date medical knowledge, and
strengthen privacy and ethical guidelines. As LLMs evolve, they could become

clinicians, and policymakers to understand the current status and future
potentials of LLMs in CCM.

Natural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this
data. Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
BERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many
applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word
sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically
generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are
language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical
NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity
recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure
robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and
standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and
standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures
concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is
time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can
prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical
Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are
popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture
concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest
source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing
with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and
procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best
solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs
for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same
functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.

    abstract = {  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the strong potential to assist
both clinicians and the general public with their extensive medical knowledge.
However, their application in healthcare is constrained due to concerns about
the privacy of data used in training, which prevents the integration of private
and personal information because of security and ethical issues. Moreover, if
their capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to access
up-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Information
retrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder their
effectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we address
this challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP).
Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of
LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process,
RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function that
permits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medical
records, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35%
additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation for
the question-answering task.

of each component of MedKP. This enhancement advances the development of
reliable, automated medical consultation responses using LLMs, thereby

and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2
concept extraction shared task, and (2) identifying nervous system
disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse

developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline

guideline-based prompts, (3) error analysis-based instructions, and (4)
annotated samples for few-shot learning. We assessed each prompt's

consistently improved model performance. When all four components were used,
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 socres of 0.794, 0.861 for MTSamples and
0.676, 0.736 for VAERS, demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt

healthcare professionals to quickly and clearly understand the context of

considerable promise in various domains, including medical diagnosis. Rare

this context, recent news such as "ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a 4-year-old's
rare disease after 17 doctors failed" underscore LLMs' potential, yet
underexplored, role in clinically diagnosing rare diseases. To bridge this
research gap, we introduce RareBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on 4 critical dimensions
within the realm of rare diseases. Meanwhile, we have compiled the largest
open-source dataset on rare disease patients, establishing a benchmark for
future studies in this domain. To facilitate differential diagnosis of rare
diseases, we develop a dynamic few-shot prompt methodology, leveraging a
comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph synthesized from multiple knowledge
bases, significantly enhancing LLMs' diagnostic performance. Moreover, we
present an exhaustive comparative study of GPT-4's diagnostic capabilities
against those of specialist physicians. Our experimental findings underscore
the promising potential of integrating LLMs into the clinical diagnostic
process for rare diseases. This paves the way for exciting possibilities in

Similar trends were observed across the CLUE (Clinical Language Understanding

suggest that fine-tuning LLMs to biomedical data may not provide the expected

collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the

    abstract = {  Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through
continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works
typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on
various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In
this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their
corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs
and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models
in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical
question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the
3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of
cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly
worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i)
comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing
the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii)
accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest
that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen
the conclusions of future studies.

LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published

more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their

In this paper we present a completely automated method MedPromptExtract to

The source of data was Discharge Summaries (DS) from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani
Hospital (KDAH) of patients having Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). A pre-existing
tool EIGEN which leverages semi-supervised learning techniques for
high-fidelity information extraction was used to anonymize the DS, Natural
Language Processing (NLP) was used to extract data from regular fields. We used
Prompt Engineering and Large Language Model(LLM) to extract custom clinical
information from free flowing text describing the patients stay in the
hospital. Twelve features associated with occurrence of AKI were extracted. The
LLM responses were validated against clinicians annotations. Results: The
MedPromptExtracttool first subjected DS to the anonymization pipeline which
took three seconds per summary. Successful anonymization was verified by
clinicians, thereafter NLP pipeline extracted structured text from the
anonymized pdfs at the rate of 0.2 seconds per summary with 100%
accuracy.Finally DS were analysed by the LLM pipeline using Gemini Pro for the
twelve features. Accuracy metrics were calculated by comparing model responses
to clinicians annotations with seven features achieving AUCs above 0.9,
indicating high fidelity of the extraction process. Conclusion:
MedPromptExtract serves as an automated adaptable tool for efficient data
extraction from medical records with a dynamic user interface. Keywords:

validate diabetes-specific LLMs. We first developed a comprehensive data

understanding and processing various diabetes tasks compared to other LLMs.
Furthermore, clinical studies showed the potential applications of our models
in diabetes care, including providing personalized healthcare, assisting

even fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that
can include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus,
and specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the
answers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external
knowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and
conduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down
potentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured
knowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent
representations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This
distinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent
representations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for
extraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those
triplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3)
sorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving
associated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM
with background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product
recommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this
approach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable
background information from information retrieval, but also improves
performance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper

biomedical data (e.g., texts, imaging, omics, and clinical) to provide
diagnosis and treatment recommendations for cancerous conditions.~Data and
knowledge about biomedical entities like cancer, drugs, genes, proteins, and
their mechanism is spread across structured (knowledge bases (KBs)) and
unstructured (e.g., scientific articles) sources. A large-scale knowledge graph
(KG) can be constructed by integrating and extracting facts about semantically
interrelated entities and relations. Such a KG not only allows exploration and
question answering (QA) but also enables domain experts to deduce new
knowledge. However, exploring and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for
non-domain users due to their lack of understanding of the data assets and
semantic technologies. In this paper, we develop a domain KG to leverage
cancer-specific biomarker discovery and interactive QA. For this, we
constructed a domain ontology called OncoNet Ontology (ONO), which enables
semantic reasoning for validating gene-disease (different types of cancer)
relations. The KG is further enriched by harmonizing the ONO, metadata,
controlled vocabularies, and biomedical concepts from scientific articles by
employing BioBERT- and SciBERT-based information extractors. Further, since the
biomedical domain is evolving, where new findings often replace old ones,
without having access to up-to-date scientific findings, there is a high chance
an AI system exhibits concept drift while providing diagnosis and treatment.
Therefore, we fine-tune the KG using large language models (LLMs) based on more
recent articles and KBs.
