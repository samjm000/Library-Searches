significantly improved clinical predictive capabilities. Leveraging clinical
notes and multivariate time-series EHR, existing models often lack the medical
context relevent to clinical tasks, prompting the incorporation of external

KG knowledge have primarily focused on structured knowledge extraction,
neglecting unstructured data modalities and semantic high dimensional medical
knowledge. In response, we propose REALM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR representations that address
these limitations. Firstly, we apply Large Language Model (LLM) to encode long
context clinical notes and GRU model to encode time-series EHR data. Secondly,
we prompt LLM to extract task-relevant medical entities and match entities in
professionally labeled external knowledge graph (PrimeKG) with corresponding
medical knowledge. By matching and aligning with clinical standards, our
framework eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency. Lastly, we propose
an adaptive multimodal fusion network to integrate extracted knowledge with
multimodal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on MIMIC-III mortality and
readmission tasks showcase the superior performance of our REALM framework over
baselines, emphasizing the effectiveness of each module. REALM framework
contributes to refining the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare and

challenging due to the context-heavy nature of processing medical records.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution by facilitating
reasoning over large text sources. However, there are many parameters to
optimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation
study exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect
information retrieval for the clinical domain.
  Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record
(EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and
general-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf
decoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each
model, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.
  Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts
retrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model,
consistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models.
However, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and
query text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of
these models to guide future design of retrieval systems.
  Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query
formulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance
of these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new
domains. Further studies such as this one are vital for guiding
empirically-grounded development of retrieval frameworks, such as in the
context of RAG, for the clinical domain.

    abstract = {  Purpose: In radiology, large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, have
recently gained attention, and their utility is being rapidly evaluated.
However, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in clinical
applications due to limitations such as hallucinations and insufficient
referencing. To address these issues, we focus on the latest technology,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables LLMs to reference reliable
external knowledge (REK). Specifically, this study examines the utility and
reliability of a recently released RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for
staging lung cancer.
  Materials and methods: We summarized the current lung cancer staging
guideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We then tasked
NotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings
and evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we performed the same task using a
gold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), both with and without the REK.
  Results: NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer
staging experiment, outperforming GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the
REK and 25% without it. Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in
searching reference locations within the REK.
  Conclusion: NotebookLM successfully performed lung cancer staging by
utilizing the REK, demonstrating superior performance compared to GPT-4o.
Additionally, it provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK,
allowing radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's
responses and detect possible hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights
the potential of NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, in image diagnosis.

Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained
popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents
challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer
models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based
large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical
notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we
selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria
needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility
criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based
on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with
the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the
extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we
evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2

eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed
the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among
the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset.
Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this
study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising
scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid
of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.

prompts, where JSON data was converted to text via an LLM, summarized, and
mapped into graph structures representing key treatment relationships. Final
recommendations were generated by querying relevant graph summaries. Both were
evaluated using a set of patient descriptions, each with four associated
questions.
  As shown in Table 1, Agentic RAG achieved a 100% adherence (24/24) with no
hallucinations or incorrect treatments. Graph-RAG had 95.8% adherence (23/24)

healthcare due to the wide adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems.
The complexity of the medical text such as diverse length, mixed text types,
and full of medical jargon, poses a great challenge for developing effective
deep learning models. BERT has presented state-of-the-art results in many NLP
tasks, such as text classification and question answering. However, the
standalone BERT model cannot deal with the complexity of the medical text,
especially the lengthy clinical notes. Herein, we develop a new model called
KG-MTT-BERT (Knowledge Graph Enhanced Multi-Type Text BERT) by extending the
BERT model for long and multi-type text with the integration of the medical
knowledge graph. Our model can outperform all baselines and other
state-of-the-art models in diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification, which
requires comprehensive medical text for accurate classification. We also
demonstrated that our model can effectively handle multi-type text and the
integration of medical knowledge graph can significantly improve the
performance.

well-informed decisions regarding patient care. Summarizing clinical notes
further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks

errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the
most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that
incorporating prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts
the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also
leads to increased output variance, resulting in notably divergent outputs even
when prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a
model-agnostic Soft Prompt-Based Calibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft
prompts to diminish variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based
summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs
indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively
curbs variance for various LLMs, providing a more uniform and dependable
solution for summarizing vital medical information.

contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical
assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult
critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods,
including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the
performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world
clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and
then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by
identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different
prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior
performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and
text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting
strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable
efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.
Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for

validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also
establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.

outstanding performance on the RE task with an F1 score of 93.74 (1.15\%
improvement). For the TE task, Llama2-7B scored 79.45 (14.26\% improvement),
and MedAlpaca-7B achieved the highest F1 score of 93.45 (0.94\% improvement) on
the UC task. The ablation study revealed that while MTL increased efficiency
with a slight trade-off in performance, RAG significantly boosted overall
accuracy.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} This study presents a novel RAMIE framework that
demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-task information extraction for
DS-related data from clinical records. Our framework can potentially be applied
to other domains.

guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific
training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and
science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different
LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and systematic experimental study on prompt engineering for five
clinical NLP tasks: Clinical Sense Disambiguation, Biomedical Evidence
Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Medication Status Extraction, and
Medication Attribute Extraction. We assessed the prompts proposed in recent
literature, including simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, and
anticipatory prompts, and introduced two new types of prompts, namely heuristic
prompting and ensemble prompting. We evaluated the performance of these prompts
on three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-3.5, BARD, and LLAMA2. We also contrasted
zero-shot prompting with few-shot prompting, and provide novel insights and
guidelines for prompt engineering for LLMs in clinical NLP. To the best of our
knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of
different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of
generative AI, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in
this area.

KARE constructs a comprehensive multi-source KG by integrating biomedical

dense medical knowledge structuring approach enabling accurate retrieval of

patient contexts with focused, multi-faceted medical insights; and (3) a
reasoning-enhanced prediction framework that leverages these enriched contexts
to produce both accurate and interpretable clinical predictions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KARE outperforms leading models by up to
10.8-15.0% on MIMIC-III and 12.6-12.7% on MIMIC-IV for mortality and

histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research.
Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting
scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction
through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions
without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting
structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to
manual extraction by a trained human annotator.
  Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web
application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold
standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs
including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family,
which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111
histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study,
extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary.
  Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama
3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy
comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106,
respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p
<0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for
self-hosting.
  Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information
extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language.
Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing
standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate

tasks thanks to their promising performance in language understanding,
inference, and generation. It is then natural to test their feasibility in
solving the cohort recruitment task, which involves the classification of a
given paragraph of medical text into disease label(s). However, when applied to
knowledge-intensive problem settings such as medical text classification, where
the LLMs are expected to understand the decision made by human experts and
accurately identify the implied disease labels, the LLMs show a mediocre
performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text,
the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that
languages afford. To this end, we propose to use a knowledge graph as auxiliary
information to guide the LLMs in making predictions. Moreover, to further boost
the LLMs adapt to the problem setting, we apply a chain-of-thought (CoT) sample
selection strategy enhanced by reinforcement learning, which selects a set of
CoT samples given each individual medical report. Experimental results and

significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities.
Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can
estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has
historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this
paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge
acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models
to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning
models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the
patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.
Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI,
to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the
estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs
from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final
prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of
0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving
predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The
experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical
knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve
more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform
well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating
medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.

  Methods. We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts
across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot,

benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores
available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact,
off-by-one, thresholded).
  Results. Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with
low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy
(0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature
parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ($\alpha = 0.98$ for GPT-4o).
CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to
specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items
independent of encounter phases and communication domains.
  Conclusion. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation
and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques.
Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a

    abstract = {  Generating physician letters is a time-consuming task in daily clinical
practice. This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models
(LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a
privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings
demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for
effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an
efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited
computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the
hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific
information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style.
ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the
8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician
evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has
limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it
successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories,
recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical
benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a
4-point scale). With careful physician review and correction, automated
LLM-based physician letter generation has significant practical value.

  Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and
tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses
evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text
using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing
these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques
and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for
vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss
metrics. Human-generated answers, provided by junior doctors, were used as a
comparison.
  Results: The LLM-RAG model generated answers within an average of 15-20
seconds, significantly faster than the 10 minutes typically required by humans.
Among the basic LLMs, GPT4.0 exhibited the best accuracy of 80.1%. This
accuracy was further increased to 91.4% when the model was enhanced with RAG.
Compared to the human-generated instructions, which had an accuracy of 86.3%,
the performance of the GPT4.0 RAG model demonstrated non-inferiority (p=0.610).
  Conclusions: In this case study, we demonstrated a LLM-RAG model for

  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based CDSS in correctly

medical and surgical sub-disciplines, against a human expert panel derived
ground truth. We compared performance for under 2 different CDSS practical
healthcare integration modalities: LLM-based CDSS alone (fully autonomous mode)
vs junior pharmacist + LLM-based CDSS (co-pilot, assistive mode).
  Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a RAG model with
state-of-the-art medically-related LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0 and Med-PaLM 2),
this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex
clinical vignettes across 12 different medical and surgical specialties. A
multidisciplinary expert panel assessed these cases for Drug-Related Problems
(DRPs) using the PCNE classification and graded severity / potential for harm
using revised NCC MERP medication error index. We compared.
  Results RAG-LLM performed better compared to LLM alone. When employed in a

  Conclusions This study established that a RAG-LLM based CDSS significantly

    author = {Alan B McMillan},
    abstract = {  Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.
  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical
MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned
nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety.
Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and
Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1,
smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the
LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an
automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct
answers, was the primary outcome.
  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy
(94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored
88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source
models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to
several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and
Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History,
and Artifacts and Corrections.
  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI
questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice.
These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical
environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and
integrate them into MRI workflows.

self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation
enabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizing
medication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical history
terms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes
extracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,
while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRA
coding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG and
excelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGN
demonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATC
Level 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for common
medications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-based
deferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notably
enhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves this
cost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o,
reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical coding

However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is

to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an
alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist
capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.
This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical
AI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image

helpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently
referencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides
evidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to
retrieve or synthesize new information when used as autonomous agents. This
enables them to function as specialist, patient-tailored clinical assistants.
It also simplifies regulatory compliance by allowing each component tool to be

    abstract = {  Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks.
However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on
structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the
numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM
reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data
(e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is
often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This
ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical
nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain
expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by
synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an
unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as
original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a
better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small
model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This
process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for
continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain
tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to
OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to
linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for
tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs
appear.

concepts corresponding to medical codes. In an expert evaluation with two
physicians, our method identifies $2.2\times$ more semantic matches and
$3.8\times$ more clinical abbreviations than two popular approaches that use
sentence transformers to create QA pairs. In an ML evaluation, adding our QA
pairs improves performance of GPT-4 as an extractive QA model, including on
difficult questions. In both the expert and ML evaluations, we examine
trade-offs between our method and sentence transformers for QA pair generation
depending on question difficulty.

    abstract = {  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance in
vision and text tasks. However, hallucination remains a major challenge,
especially in fields like healthcare where details are critical. In this work,
we show how MLLMs may be enhanced to support Visual RAG (V-RAG), a
retrieval-augmented generation framework that incorporates both text and visual
data from retrieved images. On the MIMIC-CXR chest X-ray report generation and
Multicare medical image caption generation datasets, we show that Visual RAG
improves the accuracy of entity probing, which asks whether a medical entities
is grounded by an image. We show that the improvements extend both to frequent
and rare entities, the latter of which may have less positive training data.
Downstream, we apply V-RAG with entity probing to correct hallucinations and
generate more clinically accurate X-ray reports, obtaining a higher RadGraph-F1
score.
